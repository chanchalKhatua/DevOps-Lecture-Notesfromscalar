# AWS Regions and Availability Zones

##   Regions

* AWS Regions are separate geographic areas that host multiple Availability Zones to provide high availability and fault tolerance. [cite: 4]

##   Availability Zone (AZ)

* An AZ is a physically isolated data center within a region, connected through low-latency links for high availability. [cite: 5]

##   Edge Locations

* Edge Locations are endpoints in the AWS global network used by CloudFront and Route 53 to cache content closer to users. [cite: 6]

##   Local Zone

* Local Zones extend AWS services closer to large population centers for ultra-low latency use cases like gaming and video editing. [cite: 7]

##   Outpost

* AWS Outposts bring AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises locations for a consistent hybrid experience. [cite: 8]

##   Wavelength

* AWS Wavelength embeds compute and storage services at telecom providers' 5G networks for ultra-low latency applications. [cite: 9]

#   IAM (Identity & Access Management)

* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user is an entity that you create in AWS to represent the person or application that uses it to interact with AWS Services. [cite: 10]
   
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. [cite: 11, 12]
   
* IAM helps protect against security breaches by allowing administrators to automate numerous user account-related tasks. [cite: 13]
   
* Best practice: Use the root user only to create your first IAM user. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]
   
* Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the Root User (e.g., using Google Authenticator for Virtual MFA). [cite: 15]

##   Best Practices

* It is strongly recommended that you do not use the "root user" for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. [cite: 16, 17]
   
* Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. [cite: 17, 18]
   
* IAM user is truly global, i.e., once an IAM user is created, it can be accessible in all the regions in AWS. [cite: 19, 20, 21, 22]
   
* Amazon S3 is also considered global, but it is not truly global. [cite: 19, 20, 21, 22]
   
* When we create a bucket in S3, it displays all the buckets of other regions in one place, so that is the reason we are calling Amazon S3 Global (but partly global). [cite: 21, 22]
   
* But IAM is 100% Global. Once you create an IAM user, you can use it anywhere in all the regions. [cite: 22]

##   Key IAM Components

* Main things in IAM:
   * Roles
   * Users
   * Policies / Permissions
   * Groups [cite: 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]
* IAM users can be accessed in the following 3 ways:
   * AWS Console
   * CLI (Command Line Interface)
   * API [cite: 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]
* In MNCs, permissions will not be provided for individual users. Create the Groups and add the users to them. [cite: 25, 26, 27]
* Users & Groups are for the End users. [cite: 26, 27]
* Roles are for the AWS Services. [cite: 26, 27]

##   IAM User Creation Steps

1.  Create an IAM user:
    * Services â†’ Security, Identity, & Compliance â†’ IAM â†’ Users â†’ Add user
    * User name: Iamuser1
    * Access type: Select both "Programmatic Access" and "AWS Management Console access"
    * Console password: Select "Custom Password" and set a password
    * Click "Next: Permissions" (Note: we are not providing any permissions as of now, just create user)
    * Once the IAM user has been created, you will see AccessKeyID and SecretAccessKey.  (Note: Once you close this window, AccessKeyID and SecretAccesskey are gone, so save it somewhere) [cite: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
2.  Group Creation:
    * Create new group
    * Group name = admins (Note: no need to add any policy now)
    * Create group
3.  Add user to this group:
    * Click on the newly created group 'admins'
    * Add users to Group
    * GroupARN = arn:aws:iam:: 540105522204:group/admins
    * Always add the permissions to the 'Groups' level, not to the 'users' level. [cite: 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
    * It's a Best Practice in the real-time. [cite: 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]

##   Policies

* When we want to add the permissions to the groups, it is through the 'Policies'. [cite: 32, 33, 34, 35]
* Default AWS Policies appear in 'Orange color Icons'. [cite: 33, 34, 35]
* One disadvantage of AWS Default Policies is that we can't customize the policies to apply to the Groups. [cite: 33, 34, 35]
* To provide customized policies to apply to Groups, we need to create a new one and apply it to the Groups. [cite: 33, 34, 35]
* Now, we will add 'Administrator Access' Permissions to the user (Iamuser1) we created. [cite: 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]
* Groups - Admins - tab  permissions - AttachPolicy - select AdministratorAccess - AttachPolicy
* Dashboard: Customize the IAM sign-in link by replacing the ID with any name to hide the ID.
    * Before Customize: <https://4234324234.signin.aws.amazon.com/console>
    * After Customize: <https://classroomuser.signin.aws.amazon.com/console>
* Open the new tab in the browser
    * <https://classroomuser.signin.aws.amazon.com/console>
    * IAM user: Iamuser1
    * password=test1234
* Now, log in using the IAM user we created. [cite: 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]
* Once logged in, we can launch an EC2 instance, as this user (Iamuser1) is provided with Admin access. [cite: 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]

##   Requirement: Create a new user with specific permissions

* Requirement: Create a new user and he should be able to only 'stop', 'start', 'reboot', and select instances. [cite: 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
* He should not have the permissions to terminate the EC2 Instances. [cite: 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
* He should not have the permissions to create the new EC2 Instance. [cite: 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
1.  Log in to your AWS Console with your root login. [cite: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
2.  IAM - Create another user
    * User name: Iamuser2
    * Access Type: Select "AWS Management Console access"
    * Select Custom Password = "<somepassword>"
    * Next: Permissions (Not selecting any group here)
    * Create user
3.  Sign out and log in using the 'Iamuser2' credentials
    * Open browser: <https://classroomuser.signin.aws.amazon.com/console>
    * Log in with Iamuser2 credentials [cite: 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]
4.  Services â†’ EC2: You will get an 'Authorization Error'. To view EC2 instances, you need to provide read permission to the user 'Iamuser2'. [cite: 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]
5.  Using Tags, we can provide permissions to this user.
    * Log in using the Root user
    * EC2 Instances
    * Select the Running Instance
    * Click on the tab
    * Add a new tag: Key = user, Value = Iamuser2
    * Save
6.  We can restrict the user to create EC2 instances and allow him to do only 'stop' and 'start' Instances by writing custom scripts. [cite: 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]
    * Open the browser and search for 'restrict aws user ec2 instance'
    * <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/restrict-ec2-iam/>
    * Copy the script and open it in any editor and customize it.
    * arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:instance/*" (Note: For every service, we have ARN (Amazon Resource Name), but for EC2, there is no ARN naming)
    * Interview Question: If anyone asks you, "ARN is not displaying for the EC2 instances?"
    * Ans: Simply say that ARN is not visible for the EC2 instances, but for the other services like S3, we have ARN URL.
    * Copy the script
    
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": \[
    {
    "Action": \[
    "ec2: StartInstances",
    "ec2: StopInstances",
    "ec2: RebootInstances"
    \],
    "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
    "ec2: ResourceTag/Owner": "Bob"
    }
    },
    "Resource":\[
    "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:111122223333:instance/*"
    \],
    "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ec2: Describe\*",
    "Resource": "\*"
    }
    \]
    }
    ```
    
    * After Customization
    
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": \[
    {
    "Action": \[
    "ec2: StartInstances",
    "ec2: StopInstances",
    "ec2: RebootInstances"
    \],
    "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
    "ec2: ResourceTag/user": "Iamuser2"
    }
    },
    "Resource": \[
    "arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:449938344550: instance/*"
    \],
    "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "ec2: Describe\*",
    "Resource": "\*"
    }
    \]
    }
    ```
    
    * Note:
    
    ```
    "Action": "ec2: Describe\*",
    "Resource": "\*"
    449938344550  Root AccountID
    ```
7.  Copy the script after customization
    * IAM User
    * Policies â†’ CreatePolicy â†’ Select JSON tab
    * Paste the customized script. [cite: 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]
8.  Review Policy
    * Name 'UserRestrictEC2Instance'
9.  Review Policy â†’ create policy
10. Now, add this policy to the user or groups.
    * Select Users â†’ 'Iamuser2' â†’ Permissions (tab) â†’ Add Permissions â†’ Attach existing policies directly
    * Filter policies = 'UserRestrictEC2Instance'
    * Select the policy ('UserRestrictEC2Instance') â†’ Review â†’ AddPermissions [cite: 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]
11. Log in to the IAM user console
    * Iamuser2/password
12. Now, try to Terminate the EC2 Instance. [cite: 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]
13. It throws an error. [cite: 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]
14. Try to Launch an EC2 instance, it throws an error. [cite: 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]
15. Like this, we can restrict the user by creating some policies and applying them. [cite: 52, 53, 54, 55, 56]
16. AWS provides the ready-made (default) policies; we need to customize them as per our requirement. [cite: 55, 56]
