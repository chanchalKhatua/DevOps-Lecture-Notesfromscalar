# Memory & Storage Management ‚Äì Detailed Notes

---

## 1. Understanding Memory Management

### Overview
- The Operating System (OS) is responsible for managing memory efficiently so that multiple processes can run without interfering with each other.  
- Memory management decides:
  1. Which process gets memory.
  2. How much memory each process gets.
  3. When memory is allocated or deallocated.  

**Analogy**: Memory management is like organizing books on a shelf. If books are not arranged properly, you may run out of space, waste space, or lose track of books. Similarly, processes may fail or run slowly if memory is mismanaged.

## 2. Types of Memory

### 2.1 Primary Memory (RAM)
- Stores instructions and data currently being used by the CPU.  
- **Characteristics**:
  - Volatile: Data is lost after power-off/reboot.  
  - Faster than secondary storage.  
  - Limited in size.  
- **Analogy**: Like a working desk ‚Äî you only keep items you‚Äôre currently using.  

### 2.2 Secondary Memory
- Long-term storage: HDD, SSD, external drives.  
- **Characteristics**:
  - Non-volatile (persists after shutdown).  
  - Slower than RAM.  
  - Much larger capacity.  
- **Analogy**: Like a bookshelf or cupboard where you store everything permanently.  

### 2.3 Cache Memory
- Small, high-speed memory between CPU and RAM.  
- Stores frequently used data to speed up processing.  
- **Characteristics**:
  - Faster than RAM, smaller in size, expensive.  
  - Volatile.  
- **Analogy**: Like sticky notes on your desk for frequently used references.  

### 2.4 Virtual Memory
- Technique that allows the system to use disk space as an extension of RAM.  
- **Mechanism**:
  - Inactive data in RAM is moved (swapped) to disk.  
  - Frees RAM for active processes.  
- **Analogy**: Like moving less-used books to the basement when the shelf is full.

## 3. Memory Management Strategies

### 3.1 Paging
- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks: **Pages (logical)** and **Frames (physical)**.  
- OS maps pages to frames.  

**Example**:  
- Process of size 10 KB, page size = 1 KB ‚Üí 10 pages.  
- RAM has frames of 1 KB each ‚Üí process pages stored in different frames.  

**Pros**:
- Eliminates external fragmentation.  
- Simple to implement.  

**Cons**:
- Causes internal fragmentation (unused space inside frames).  

**Analogy**: A book divided into equal-sized pages. Some pages may not be completely filled, wasting space.  

---

### 3.2 Segmentation
- Divides memory into variable-sized blocks called segments.  
- Each segment = logical unit (e.g., code, data, stack).  

**Example**:
- Code Segment = 5 KB, Data Segment = 3 KB, Stack Segment = 2 KB.  
- OS allocates memory blocks of respective sizes.  

**Pros**:
- Matches program structure.  
- No internal fragmentation.  

**Cons**:
- Causes external fragmentation.  

**Analogy**: A book divided into chapters of different lengths.

### 3.3 Comparison: Paging vs Segmentation

| Feature              | Paging (Fixed Size)                  | Segmentation (Variable Size)      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Block Size           | Fixed (pages/frames)                  | Variable (segments)               |
| Fragmentation        | Internal fragmentation                | External fragmentation            |
| Logical Division     | Divides by memory size                | Divides by program structure      |
| Example              | Book split into equal-sized pages     | Book split into chapters          |

## 4. Virtual Memory

### Why Needed?
- Physical RAM is limited.  
- Virtual memory expands usable memory by using disk.  

### Benefits
- Enables multitasking.  
- Cost-effective compared to adding more RAM.  

### Challenges
1. **Disk Thrashing**  
   - Excessive swapping between RAM and disk.  
   - CPU spends more time swapping than executing.  
   - **Analogy**: Constantly running to the basement for books.  

2. **Memory Overcommitment**  
   - Allocating more memory than physically available.  
   - May crash if processes actually use all allocated memory.  

---

## 5. Garbage Collection

### Purpose
- Automatically reclaim unused memory.  

**Analogy**: Waste collector removing garbage to free up space.  

### In Java
- Command to monitor:
  ```bash
  jstat -gc <PID> 1000
````

* Example pipeline:

  ```bash
  ps -aux | grep "script" | awk '{print $2}' | xargs jstat -gc 1000
  ```

---

## 6. Memory Allocation Techniques

### 6.1 Static Allocation

* Memory allocated at **compile time**.
* Fixed throughout program execution.
* **Drawback**: Wastage if allocated memory not fully used.

### 6.2 Dynamic Allocation

* Memory allocated at **runtime** as needed.
* More flexible, reduces wastage.

### Allocation Strategies

1. **Stack Allocation (Static)**

   * Local variables in a function.
   * Freed after function exits.

2. **Heap Allocation (Dynamic)**

   * Objects created/destroyed at runtime.
   * Used in object-oriented programming.

## 7. Practical Linux Commands (Memory Monitoring)

| Command             | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `free -h`           | Total, used, free, cache, swap (human-readable). |
| `top`               | Real-time memory + CPU usage.                    |
| `cat /proc/meminfo` | Detailed memory info.                            |
| `vmstat 1`          | System stats every second.                       |

### Important `vmstat` Parameters

* **R**: Running processes.
* **B**: Blocked processes.
* **SWPD**: Swap memory used.
* **SI**: Memory swapped in (disk ‚Üí RAM).
* **SO**: Memory swapped out (RAM ‚Üí disk).

> High SI/SO = Disk thrashing.

---

## 8. Swap Memory

### What is Swap?

* Disk space used when RAM is full.
* Works with virtual memory.

### Practical Demonstration

```bash
# Check existing swap
sudo swapon --show

# Create 1GB swap file
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile

# Secure the file
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

# Setup & enable swap
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Verify
sudo swapon --show
```

### Make Swap Permanent

Edit `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0
```

### Issues

* Too much swap ‚Üí Disk thrashing.
* Swap size should not be excessively large.

---

## 9. Storage Management

### Historical Devices

* **Magnetic Tapes** ‚Üí Backups.
* **Floppy Disks** ‚Üí Small, portable storage.
* **CD/DVDs** ‚Üí Software, multimedia distribution.
* **HDDs** ‚Üí Magnetic disks, large capacity.

### Modern Storage

* **SSD** ‚Üí Faster, reliable (no moving parts).
* **Cloud Storage** ‚Üí Internet-based storage (Google Drive, Dropbox).

## 10. Types of Storage

| Type            | Description                       | Examples             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Direct Access   | Local storage, direct access      | HDD, SSD, USB        |
| Network Storage | Storage via LAN/WAN               | NAS, SAN             |
| Cloud Storage   | Remote, internet-accessed storage | AWS S3, Google Drive |

---

## 11. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

* Combines multiple disks for speed and fault tolerance.

| RAID Level | Description                       | Fault Tolerance |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| RAID 0     | Striping (performance only)       | ‚ùå               |
| RAID 1     | Mirroring (data duplicated)       | ‚úÖ               |
| RAID 5     | Striping + parity                 | ‚úÖ               |
| RAID 10    | Mirroring + striping (best combo) | ‚úÖ‚úÖ              |

---

## 12. Logical Volume Management (LVM)

### Concept

* Combines multiple disks into a single pool (**Volume Group**) which can be split into **Logical Volumes**.

### Example

* 3 √ó 10 GB disks ‚Üí 30 GB Volume Group.
* Create two logical volumes of 15 GB each.

### Basic Commands

```bash
# List block devices
lsblk

# Create Physical Volume
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdX

# Create Volume Group
sudo vgcreate VGname /dev/sdX

# Create Logical Volume
sudo lvcreate -L 10G -n LVname VGname

# Mount volume
sudo mount /dev/VGname/LVname /mount-point

# Extend Logical Volume
sudo lvextend -L +5G /dev/VGname/LVname
```

---

## 13. Extra Tools for Memory/Storage Monitoring

* `htop` ‚Üí Interactive process viewer.
* `sar -r` ‚Üí Historical memory usage (sysstat package).
* `smem` ‚Üí Per-process memory usage breakdown.
* `iostat` ‚Üí Disk I/O monitoring.
* `zram` ‚Üí Compressed swap in RAM.

---

## 14. Diagram Suggestions (for revision)

* Paging vs Segmentation (fixed vs variable).
* Virtual Memory (RAM ‚Üî Swap ‚Üî Disk).
* RAID levels layout.
* LVM hierarchy (PV ‚Üí VG ‚Üí LV).

---
