## Threads

### Introduction to Threads
- A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
  - Unlike processes, which are independent units of execution, threads exist within a process and execute instructions sequentially.
  - A single process can contain multiple threads, which are lightweight and share resources with each other.
  - These shared resources include memory, open files, and other attributes of the process.

### Features of Threads
- Threads are beneficial because they allow parallelism and concurrency within a single process.
- Threads share:
  - **Memory space**: All threads in the same process share the same memory address space.
  - **Resources**: Threads within a process share resources like open files and network connections.
  - **Data**: They can communicate with each other through shared data, which allows efficient inter-thread communication without the need for inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.

### Comparison of Processes and Threads

### Real-Life Implications
- When managing **large-scale infrastructure**, the concepts of processes and threads are critical for efficiency and performance.
  - For example, **infrastructure provisioning** often uses multi-threading to handle concurrent tasks, speeding up deployment.
  - In **CI/CD pipelines**, tasks like testing, building, and deploying can be run concurrently in different threads or processes.
  - **Linux scripting** allows you to use threads for parallel tasks like file system monitoring, where different threads handle different events simultaneously.
  
**Ask Students:**  
- What are some real-life implications of using threads vs. processes?

## Concurrency and Parallelism

### Concurrency
- **Concurrency** refers to a system's ability to handle multiple tasks or processes at the same time.
  - Concurrency does not necessarily mean the tasks are running simultaneously but rather that they are in progress during overlapping time periods.
  - **Example Analogy:** A chef multitasking in the kitchen.
    - With one hand, the chef is boiling pasta, and with the other, they are chopping vegetables. Both tasks are progressing concurrently, although they may not be performed exactly at the same time.
  
### Parallelism
- **Parallelism** takes concurrency a step further by executing tasks truly at the same time, often on different CPU cores or processors.
  - Parallelism is about dividing work into smaller, independent tasks and running them simultaneously for faster completion.
  - **Example Analogy:** Multiple chefs working in a kitchen.
    - One chef boils pasta while another chops vegetables, both actions occurring at the same time but performed by different chefs.

### Combining Concurrency and Parallelism
- Concurrency and parallelism are not mutually exclusive; they often work together to optimize performance.
  - **Concurrency** allows tasks to make progress simultaneously.
  - **Parallelism** improves performance by running these tasks at the same time.
  
  - **Illustration:**
    ![Concurrency and Parallelism](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkYvuHDnC.png)

### Use Cases

1. **Input/Output (I/O) Bound Tasks**
   - I/O bound tasks are tasks that spend most of their time waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading from disk, network operations).
   - The time taken to receive a response creates natural pauses in task execution.
   - **Optimal Approach:** Use **concurrency** for I/O bound tasks to take advantage of waiting periods and allow other tasks to proceed in the meantime.
   - **Example:** Sending a request to a remote server, such as sending a message to the moon. Since it takes a long time to get a response, the system can perform other tasks during the waiting period.

2. **CPU Bound Tasks**
   - CPU bound tasks are those that require significant processing power, such as performing calculations or executing algorithms.
   - **Optimal Approach:** Use **parallelism** to split the task into smaller parts and distribute them across multiple CPU cores. Each core handles a portion of the task, speeding up overall execution.
   - **Example:** A large mathematical computation divided into smaller problems and processed across multiple CPU cores.

> **Note:** More CPU cores result in more concurrency and parallelism.
  - A 4-core CPU can handle more processes and threads than a single-core CPU. Similarly, an 8-core CPU doubles the concurrency potential of a 4-core CPU.

### CI/CD Pipeline Example
- **CI/CD pipelines** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) are practical examples of how concurrency and parallelism are used.
  - Tasks in a CI/CD pipeline include testing, building, and deploying code, all of which benefit from parallel and concurrent execution.

1. **Sequential Execution**  
   - Tasks are executed one after the other.
     - Task 1 ‚Üí Task 2 ‚Üí Task 3 ‚Üí Task 4 ‚Üí Task 5.
     - This is simple but can be slow, especially if one task takes a long time.

2. **Concurrent and Parallel Execution**  
   - **Parallelism** allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously.  
     - Example: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3 run at the same time.
   - **Concurrency** allows new tasks to start as soon as other tasks complete.
     - Example: After Task 1 finishes, Task 4 starts, and after Task 2 finishes, Task 5 starts.
     - This results in faster overall pipeline execution.

## Synchronization Primitives

### Introduction to Synchronization Primitives
- **Synchronization primitives** are tools and mechanisms used to manage the access of multiple threads to shared resources. 
- They ensure that threads do not interfere with each other when accessing or modifying shared data.
- **Analogy:** Think of a playground where children take turns on the swing or slide. Rules are necessary to ensure that no child gets hurt or monopolizes the equipment.

### Types of Synchronization Primitives

1. **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock)**  
   - A **mutex** ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
   - **Example Analogy:** A slide in a playground where only one child can use it at a time. If another child tries to use it, they must wait.
   - In programming terms, if one thread is using a resource (like a shared variable), other threads attempting to use the same resource will be blocked until the first thread releases it.
   - **Real-Life Example:** At home, if the bathroom is occupied, you must wait until it‚Äôs free before using it.

2. **Spin Lock**  
   - A **spin lock** is similar to a mutex but operates slightly differently. Instead of putting a thread to sleep while waiting for the resource, the thread continuously checks (or spins) to see if the resource becomes available.
   - **Example Analogy:** Waiting outside a public bathroom and constantly checking if it's available instead of stepping away and waiting for a signal.
   - Spin locks are useful when the wait time is expected to be short, but they consume more CPU resources because the thread is actively checking the lock.
   - **Use Case:** Spin locks are used when context switching is easy and the overhead of waiting is greater than the cost of spinning.

3. **Semaphore**  
   - A **semaphore** is a signaling mechanism that controls access to a resource with a limited number of instances.
   - **Example Analogy:** Time slots in a playground where different groups of children can use the swings during designated times.
   - In programming, a semaphore allows multiple threads to access a limited number of identical resources, such as limited instances of a server or a database connection pool.


---
### 1. **Binary Semaphore**

* Can take only **0 or 1** values.
* Works like a **lock/unlock switch**.
* Similar to a **mutex**, but not strictly bound to ownership (any thread can release it).
* Used for **mutual exclusion** (only one process can access critical section at a time).

  ```
  0 ‚Üí Locked
  1 ‚Üí Unlocked
  ```

---

### 2. **Counting Semaphore**

* Has a counter (initial value = number of available resources).
* **acquire (P / wait)** ‚Üí decreases counter by 1.
* **release (V / signal)** ‚Üí increases counter by 1.
* If counter = 0 ‚Üí no process can acquire (must wait).
* Example: counter = 3 ‚Üí at most 3 threads can access resource at the same time.

---

### 3. **Mutex vs Semaphore**

| Feature   | Binary Semaphore            | Mutex                   |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Ownership | Any thread can release      | Only owner can unlock   |
| Values    | 0 or 1                      | Locked / Unlocked       |
| Use case  | Signaling, mutual exclusion | Strict mutual exclusion |

---

### 4. **Example**

#### Counting Semaphore (3 resources)

```
Initial counter = 3

T1 acquires ‚Üí counter = 2
T2 acquires ‚Üí counter = 1
T3 acquires ‚Üí counter = 0  (No more available)
T4 tries to acquire ‚Üí must wait
```

When one thread releases ‚Üí counter increases, waiting thread can proceed.

---

üëâ From your notes:

* **‚ÄúBinary ‚Üí 0 locked / 1 unlocked‚Äù** ‚úÖ correct.
* **‚Äúacquire decreases / release increases‚Äù** ‚úÖ that‚Äôs for counting semaphores.
* **‚Äúonly when counter > 0 acquire allowed‚Äù** ‚úÖ correct.

---
## **mutex vs semaphore** in a structured way:

---

## üîë **Mutex (MUTual EXclusion Object)**

* A **lock** mechanism.
* Only **one thread/process** can hold it at a time.
* **Ownership rule**: The thread that locks (acquires) the mutex must be the same one to unlock (release) it.
* Used for **mutual exclusion in critical sections**.

**Example:**
Only one thread can write to a file at a time.

---

## üîë **Semaphore**

* A **signaling + counting mechanism**.
* Two types:

  1. **Binary Semaphore** ‚Üí works like a mutex but **no strict ownership rule**.
  2. **Counting Semaphore** ‚Üí allows multiple threads (up to a counter value) to access resources.
* Used to **control access to a limited number of resources**.

**Example:**
3 printers ‚Üí at most 3 threads can print simultaneously. Semaphore initialized to 3.

---

## üÜö **Mutex vs Semaphore**

| Feature   | Mutex                                        | Semaphore                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Type      | Lock mechanism                               | Signaling + resource counter                 |
| Values    | 0 or 1 (locked/unlocked)                     | 0 to N (resource count)                      |
| Ownership | Only owner can unlock                        | Any thread can signal (release)              |
| Use Case  | Strict mutual exclusion (1 thread at a time) | Multiple resource access control             |
| Blocking  | If locked, other threads wait                | If count = 0, other threads wait             |
| Overhead  | Lighter (just lock/unlock)                   | More flexible but heavier                    |
| Example   | Protect shared variable                      | Limit connections to a database (say max 10) |

---

‚úÖ **In short**

* Use a **mutex** when you need to protect a **single shared resource**.
* Use a **semaphore** when you need to control **multiple resource access** or signal between threads.

## Major Issues in Concurrency and Parallelism

1. **Race Condition**
   - A **race condition** occurs when two or more threads attempt to access shared data at the same time, leading to inconsistent or unexpected results.
   - **Example:** Two people in a kitchen both trying to use the last egg at the same time for different recipes.
   - **Cause:** Parallelism where multiple threads/processes access shared data simultaneously.
   - **Solution:** Use synchronization primitives (like **mutex**) to ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time.

2. **Deadlock**
   - A **deadlock** occurs when two or more processes are stuck waiting for each other to release resources, causing a standstill.
   - **Example:** Cars at a four-way intersection where all drivers wait for the others to move, leading to gridlock.
---
## ‚úÖ **Necessary Conditions for Deadlock** (Coffman‚Äôs conditions)

Deadlock can only occur if **all four** are true:

1. **Mutual Exclusion** ‚Üí At least one resource is held in a non-shareable mode.
2. **Hold and Wait** ‚Üí A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for another.
3. **No Preemption** ‚Üí Resources cannot be forcibly taken away.
4. **Circular Wait** ‚Üí A set of processes form a cycle, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

üëâ To **prevent deadlocks**, we must break at least one of these conditions.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Deadlock Prevention Techniques**

### 1. **Mutual Exclusion**

* Some resources **must** be non-shareable (e.g., printers).
* But wherever possible, make resources **shareable** (e.g., read-only files).

---

### 2. **Hold and Wait**

* Require processes to **request all resources at once**.
* Or allow a process to **request resources only when it holds none**.
* Drawback ‚Üí **low resource utilization**.

---

### 3. **No Preemption**

* If a process is holding resources but requests another that cannot be allocated ‚Üí **force it to release its current resources**.
* Those resources are preempted and reallocated to other processes.
* Process restarts later.

---

### 4. **Circular Wait**

* Impose a **total ordering** on resources (e.g., R1 < R2 < R3).
* Processes can only request resources in ascending order.
* This prevents circular waiting.

---

## ‚ö° Other Approaches

* **Deadlock Avoidance (Banker‚Äôs Algorithm)** ‚Üí Decide dynamically if a resource allocation is safe.
* **Deadlock Detection & Recovery** ‚Üí Allow deadlock to occur, then detect and recover (e.g., kill a process, preempt resources).

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
To prevent deadlocks ‚Üí **break at least one Coffman condition** (Mutual Exclusion, Hold & Wait, No Preemption, Circular Wait).

---

3. **Livelock**
   - * A **livelock** occurs when two or more threads/processes keep **responding to each other‚Äôs actions**, continuously changing state, but **no one makes real progress**. Unlike **deadlock** (where all are stuck              waiting), in livelock the threads are *active but useless*.
   - **Example:** Two backup servers both trying to become the primary server, backing off when they detect the other server's attempts, leading to no resolution.
---

### ‚ö° **Example of Livelock**

Two people walking in a narrow corridor:

* Both move left ‚Üí block each other.
* Both move right ‚Üí still block each other.
* They keep reacting but **never pass through**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Ways to Prevent Livelock**

1. **Randomized Delays (Backoff strategy)**

   * Introduce random wait times before retrying.
   * Example: Ethernet‚Äôs **exponential backoff** algorithm.

2. **Assign Priorities**

   * Give one thread/process higher priority so it proceeds first.
   * Avoids endless back-and-forth adjustments.

3. **Fair Scheduling / Ordering**

   * Enforce a rule like FIFO (first-come, first-served).
   * Example: A queue for accessing a shared resource.

---

### ‚úÖ Quick Comparison with Deadlock

| **Deadlock**                                        | **Livelock**                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Processes are blocked, no CPU activity              | Processes are active but not progressing                                 |
| Static state (waiting forever)                      | Dynamic state (keep changing but useless)                                |
| Example: Dining philosophers not picking chopsticks | Philosophers repeatedly putting down & picking chopsticks without eating |



4. **Starvation**
   - **Starvation** occurs when a process or thread waits indefinitely because other processes are continuously prioritized.
   - **Example:** A person waiting in a regular queue at a temple while others use a VIP queue, causing the person to never progress.
   - **Solution:** Implement **aging**, Aging gradually increases the priority of processes that have been waiting for a long time, ensuring that even lowpriority processes eventually get a chance to execute.

# üñ•Ô∏è Practical Demonstration: `.bashrc` File

## 1. **Overview**

* The `.bashrc` file is a **hidden configuration file** in the user‚Äôs home directory (`~`).
* It is executed **whenever a new terminal session starts in interactive mode**.
* Purpose: Customize the shell ‚Üí environment variables, aliases, functions, prompt style, etc.

---

## 2. **Editing the `.bashrc` File**

```bash
cd ~          # Move to home directory
pwd           # Confirm current path
vi ~/.bashrc  # Open .bashrc in Vim
```

Inside `.bashrc`, you can add your custom settings.

---

## 3. **Customizing the Prompt**

Modify the `PS1` variable to change how your terminal prompt looks.

Example:

```bash
PS1="\u \w\$ "
```

* `\u` ‚Üí username
* `\w` ‚Üí current working directory
* `\$` ‚Üí `$` for normal user, `#` for root

üëâ After this, your prompt will look like:

```
username ~/current/path $
```

---

## 4. **Applying Changes**

After saving `.bashrc`, reload it:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This applies changes immediately without restarting the terminal.

---

## 5. **Creating Aliases**

Aliases are shortcuts for long commands.

Example:

```bash
alias pp='pwd'
```

Now typing `pp` will run `pwd`.

### Making Aliases Permanent

* Add alias lines to your `.bashrc`.
* Reload with:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## 6. **Extra Ideas**

You can also add:

* **Environment variables**:

  ```bash
  export EDITOR=vim
  export PATH=$PATH:~/scripts
  ```
* **Functions**:

  ```bash
  mkcd () { mkdir -p "$1" && cd "$1"; }
  ```

  Usage: `mkcd new_folder` ‚Üí creates and enters folder.

---

‚úÖ **In summary:**
`.bashrc` = your personal terminal customization file ‚Üí edit, add aliases/variables, reload with `source ~/.bashrc`.
