# DevOps Overview

This document outlines a DevOps overview, covering key concepts, phases, and relevant technologies.

## Introduction to DevOps

The introductory class for this DevOps overview starts at 9:06 PM.

### Why are Python and DSA important for a DevOps Engineer?

* **Problem Solving Skill**

* **Troubleshooting**

* **Automation and Scripting**

DevOps is a practice where development and operations teams collaborate to improve software delivery time.

## Architecture Types

### Monolithic Architecture

In a monolithic architecture, components like User Interface, Business Logic, Authorization & Authentication, and Payment are tightly integrated within a single system.

**Challenges:**

* **Scaling:** Both vertical (e.g., increasing RAM, CPU, storage on a single server) and horizontal scaling (adding more servers) present challenges as different components experience varying loads.

* **Outages**

* **Redeployment**

### Microservice Architecture

This architecture involves loosely coupled and independently deployable services.

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Scaling**

* **Easier Deployments**

* **Fault Isolation**

## How the Internet Works

When you type a website like "abcd.com" into your browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to get the IP address associated with "abcd.com". The DNS acts like a phonebook, mapping domain names to IP addresses. The browser then uses this IP address to connect to the website's server.

### IP Addresses

IP addresses are managed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

* **IPv4:** Uses 4 bytes (e.g., A.B.C.D) with each part ranging from 0-255, leading to approximately 4 billion possible addresses. There is a problem of IP address exhaustion with IPv4.

* **Private IPs:** These IP addresses are reserved for private networks (e.g., 10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255, 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.235, 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255).

* **Public IPs:** These are internet-facing IP addresses.

* **NAT (Network Address Translator):** Used for translating network addresses.

## Phases of DevOps

1. **Planning:** Tools like Jira and Confluence are used in this phase.

2. **Coding:** Version control systems such as GitHub and Bitbucket are used.

3. **Build:** Code is converted into an executable form using tools like Maven and Gradle.

4. **Testing:** Tools like Selenium and Postman are utilized for testing.

5. **Deployment:** Different deployment strategies include:

   * **Blue-Green Deployment:** Involves two identical environments (Blue and Green). One is active (Blue) while the new version is deployed to the inactive one (Green). Traffic is then switched to the Green environment once it's ready.

   * **Shadow Deployment:** A new version (Shadow) runs alongside the Main version, receiving a copy of real production traffic, but its output doesn't affect the production environment.

   * **Canary Deployment:** A new version is rolled out to a small subset of users (e.g., in a specific region like Pakistan), observed for performance, and then gradually rolled out to more users (e.g., India, Sri Lanka).

   * **Rolling Update:** New versions are deployed by gradually replacing old instances with new ones, ensuring continuous uptime. Health checks are performed, and unhealthy servers are terminated.

6. **Operate Phase:** This involves monitoring, maintenance, logging, and scaling. Other aspects include security and alerting.

## Top Technologies in the Market (DevOps)

### Cloud Platforms

* **AWS:** EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Group

* **Azure:** Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)

* **GCP:** Instances, Instance Group, Instance Template

### Scripting Languages

* Python

* Shell

* Node.js

* Groovy (for Jenkins pipelines)

* Ruby

* Go

### CI/CD & Version Control

* GitHub

* ArgoCD (for GitOps)

* Jenkins

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* Terraform (AWS, Azure, GCP)

* CloudFormation (AWS)

### Configuration Management

* Ansible

* Puppet

* Chef

### Containerization

* Docker

* Kubernetes

  * Containers are described as a package containing all necessary items to run a software application, including config files and environment variables.

### Monitoring Tools

* **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Prometheus, Zabbix, Nagios

* **Cloud Monitoring:** CloudWatch (AWS), Azure Monitor

* **Container Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana

### Logging Tools

* Kibana

* ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## DevOps Learning Modules

The learning path for DevOps is structured into several modules:

* **Module 1:** Python

* **Module 2:** DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

* **Module 3:** Linux and Computer Systems (2.5 months), covering Shell Scripting, Computer Networks, and Databases

* **Module 4:** DevOps Tools (2.5 months), including Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, GitHub, ArgoCD, GitOps, Git, Prometheus, Grafana

* **Module 5:** AWS

* **Module 6:** System Design

* **Module 7:** Advanced DSA

## Job Opportunities

* **DevOps Engineer:** Focuses on automation, infrastructure provisioning, and containerization. Responsibilities include architecture, cloud infrastructure, and automation.

* **SRE (Site Reliability Engineer):** Focuses on automation, reliability, uptime, and incident planning.
