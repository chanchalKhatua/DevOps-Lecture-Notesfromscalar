## Kubernetes Jobs

Kubernetes Jobs are used to run tasks that execute to completion, rather than continuously running services. These jobs can be used for:

- **One-time tasks** (e.g., data migration, report generation)
- **Parallel processing**
- **Retries and completions management**

### Example: Running a Simple Job
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: example-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: example-container
        image: busybox
        command: ["echo", "Hello, Kubernetes!"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```
```sh
kubectl get job
```
---

## Kubernetes CronJobs

### Example: Running a Job Every Day at Midnight
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: daily-job
spec:
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: daily-container
            image: busybox
            command: ["echo", "Running daily job"]
          restartPolicy: Never
```
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: demo-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *"  # Runs every 2 minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      completions: 5        # Each Job requires 5 successful pods
      parallelism: 2        # Run 2 pods at a time
      backoffLimit: 3       # Retry a failed pod 3 times
      activeDeadlineSeconds: 60  # Each job must complete in 60 seconds
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: worker
            image: busybox
            command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Running task; sleep 10"]
          restartPolicy: Never

```
If we want to stop cron job(make pause)
```sh
kubectl patch cronjob demo-cronjob -p '{"spec": {"suspend": true}}'
```
or 
edit JSON file
```sh
kubectl edit cronjob demo-cronjob
```

## Use Cases

### **Backup Tasks**
- Periodic backups of databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Exporting logs or data snapshots to cloud storage

### **Batch Processing**
- Generating reports (e.g., monthly sales reports)
- Running analytics jobs on collected data

### **Cleanup Jobs**
- Deleting old logs, cache, or expired records
- Cleaning up orphaned resources

### **Data Import/Export**
- Fetching external data and importing it into a database

### **Security Scans & Compliance Checks**
- Running vulnerability scans on application containers
- Checking compliance rules on cloud resources

---

## Networking in Kubernetes Jobs
- **Pod Communication**: Jobs run in pods and can interact with other services using Kubernetes networking.
- **Service Discovery**: Jobs can use Kubernetes Services to reach databases or APIs.
- **Ingress & Egress Controls**: Use NetworkPolicies to control job access to external/internal resources.

## Jobs in Kubernetes



### **Definition:**
A Kubernetes Job ensures that a specified number of pods run to successful completion. It is used to manage batch or one-off tasks efficiently within a Kubernetes cluster.

### **Parameters:**
1. **Parallelism:** Specifies how many pods can run simultaneously.
2. **Completions:** Specifies the total number of successful pod runs required to consider the job complete.
3. **backoffLimit:** The number of retries before the job is considered failed.
4. **activeDeadlineSeconds:** The time duration before the job is considered failed, even if it's still running.

### **Examples:**
- **Example 1:**
  - Parallelism = 3, Completions = 3
  - Three pods will run simultaneously, each completing once. After three successful completions, the job terminates.

- **Example 2:**
  - Parallelism = 3, Completions = 5
  - Three pods run simultaneously. Once a pod completes its task, another will start, continuing until five total completions are achieved.
 - **Example 3:**
     - completions: 5 # Total 5 successful runs required
     - parallelism: 2 # Run 2 pods at a time
     - backoffLimit: 3 # Retry a failed pod 3 times before marking job as failed
     - activeDeadlineSeconds: 10 # Job must finish within 60 seconds

### **Use Cases:**
- Running batch processing tasks like database migrations.
- Automating tasks that need a fixed number of successful runs.
- Distributed computing where tasks can be split into parallelized workloads.

## Services in Kubernetes



### **Definition:**
Services in Kubernetes provide a stable network endpoint for accessing pods. They abstract the complexity of networking and ensure seamless communication within and outside the cluster.

### **Types of Services:**
1. **ClusterIP (Default):**
   - Exposes the service on an internal IP address.
   - Accessible only within the cluster.
   - **Use Case:** Internal communication between application components.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-clusterip-service
   spec:
     type: ClusterIP
     ports:
       - port: 80
     selector:
       app: my-app
   ```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: html
    configMap:
      name: nginx-html
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-html
data:
  index.html: |
    <html><body><h1>Welcome to My Nginx Pod</h1></body></html>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx  # Matches the pod label
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP  # Internal service
   
   ```
### Kubernetes Port Forwarding (`kubectl port-forward`)

The `kubectl port-forward` command allows you to forward a port from a **Kubernetes resource** (like a Pod, Service, or Deployment) to your local machine.

#### **Syntax**
```sh
kubectl port-forward <resource> <LOCAL_PORT>:<TARGET_PORT>
```
- `<resource>` → The resource name (Pod, Service, etc.).
- `<LOCAL_PORT>` → The port on your local machine.
- `<TARGET_PORT>` → The port inside the Kubernetes resource.

---

#### **Examples**

### **Forward a Pod's Port**
```sh
kubectl port-forward pod/my-pod 8080:80
```
- Access the Pod's **port 80** via `localhost:8080`.

### **Forward a Service's Port**
```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80
```
- Maps **Service port 80** to `localhost:8080`.

### **Forward a Deployment's Port**
```sh
kubectl port-forward deployment/my-deployment 9090:9090
```
- Useful for accessing an app running inside a Deployment.

### **Background Execution**
```sh
kubectl port-forward pod/my-pod 8080:80 &
```
- Runs the command in the background.

---

## **How to Use It?**
Once the port is forwarded, you can access the application at:
**http://localhost:8080** (or whichever local port you specified).

2. **NodePort:**
   - Exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP address.
   - Accessible externally via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
   - **Use Case:** Simple external access during development.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-nodeport-service
   spec:
     type: NodePort
     ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
         nodePort: 30001
     selector:
       app: my-app
   ```
   ![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SknpFvOBke.png)
  ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod-1
  labels:
    app: nginx
    pod: "1" 
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: html
    configMap:
      name: nginx-html-1
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-html-1
data:
  index.html: |
    <html><body><h1>Welcome to Pod 1</h1></body></html>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod-2
  labels:
    app: nginx
    pod: "2"  
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: html
    configMap:
      name: nginx-html-2
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-html-2
data:
  index.html: |
    <html><body><h1>Welcome to Pod 2</h1></body></html>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod-3
  labels:
    app: nginx
    pod: "3"  
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: html
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: html
    configMap:
      name: nginx-html-3
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: nginx-html-3
data:
  index.html: |
    <html><body><h1>Welcome to Pod 3</h1></body></html>
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx  # Selects all pods with the app label 'nginx'
  type: NodePort  # Exposes the service externally on every node
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80        # The service port
      targetPort: 80  # The port on the pod where traffic is forwarded
      nodePort: 30007 # The external port to access the service
  ```

4. **LoadBalancer:**
   - Exposes the service externally via a cloud provider's load balancer.
   - **Use Case:** Managing external traffic in production environments.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-loadbalancer-service
   spec:
     type: LoadBalancer
     ports:
       - port: 80
     selector:
       app: my-app
   ```

5. **ExternalName:**
   - Acts as a DNS pointer to an external service.
   - **Use Case:** Redirecting Kubernetes traffic to external DNS names.
#### Kubernetes ExternalName Service Example

##### Overview
An `ExternalName` service allows Kubernetes to redirect traffic to an external domain name instead of a traditional cluster-internal service.

#### Example YAML Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-db
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: example.com # Redirects traffic to example.com
```

### Use Cases
- Connecting to an external database (e.g., AWS RDS, Azure SQL, On-Premise DB).
- Exposing an external API through Kubernetes service abstraction.

### Verify `ExternalName` Resolution
After applying the service definition, you can check the DNS resolution using a test pod:
```sh
kubectl run test-pod --image=busybox --restart=Never -it --rm -- /bin/sh
```
Inside the test pod, use `nslookup` to verify DNS resolution:
```sh
nslookup external-db
```
This should return the IP address of `example.com` or the configured external service.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: my-externalname-service
   spec:
     type: ExternalName
     externalName: external.example.com
   ```

# Best Practices for Using Kubernetes Services

## 1. Use Selectors Appropriately
### Best Practices:
- **Define clear label selectors**: Ensure your services are correctly mapping to the intended pods.
- **Avoid overly broad selectors**: Using `app=backend` without additional constraints may match unintended pods.
- **Use headless services (`ClusterIP: None`)** when you need direct pod discovery.

### Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

---

## 2. Resource Management
### Best Practices:
- **Allocate sufficient resources**: Ensure services get enough CPU/memory.
- **Use resource requests and limits**:
  ```yaml
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "256Mi"
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
  ```
- **Load balance across pods**: Use services with `ClusterIP` or `LoadBalancer` based on need.

---

## 3. Security
### Best Practices:
- **Use Network Policies**: Restrict traffic between services.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: NetworkPolicy
  metadata:
    name: restrict-external-access
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app: backend
    policyTypes:
      - Ingress
    ingress:
      - from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: frontend
  ```
- **Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Restrict who can access services.
- **Use TLS for encrypted communication**.

---

## 4. Monitoring & Logging
### Best Practices:
- **Use `kubectl logs` and `kubectl describe`** for debugging.
- **Integrate with monitoring tools** (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).
- **Enable service-level logging** to track requests.

By following these best practices, you can ensure your Kubernetes services are reliable, secure, and optimized for performance.


## Pod Management


### **Overview:**
Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They can be managed as individual units or as a group. Pod management is crucial for ensuring efficient execution of tasks and workload distribution.

### **Key Features:**
1. **Grouped Management:**
   - Pods are often managed in groups to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

2. **Log Aggregation:**
   - Logs from pods can be centralized for better debugging and monitoring.

3. **Task Distribution:**
   - Tasks can be distributed across multiple pods for efficiency.

### **Examples:**
- Running pods with specific parallelism and completion settings (as discussed under Jobs).
- Scaling pods horizontally to handle increased traffic.

---



### **Additional Notes:**
1. **Service Ports:**
   - Example: Service1 runs on port `30001`, Service2 runs on port `30002`.

2. **Pod Details:**
   - Each pod contains a container that executes tasks assigned by jobs.

3. **External Services:**
   - `ExternalName` services help connect Kubernetes traffic to external DNS names for seamless integration.

### **FAQ Examples:**
- **Question:** Can a Job run indefinitely?
  - **Answer:** No, Jobs are designed for finite tasks. For indefinite execution, consider using a Deployment.

- **Question:** What is the difference between NodePort and LoadBalancer?
  - **Answer:** NodePort exposes a service on each node’s IP and port, while LoadBalancer uses a cloud provider's external load balancer for broader access.
