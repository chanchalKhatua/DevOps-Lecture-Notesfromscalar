## **1. StatefulSets and Deployment**


### **1.1 What are StatefulSets?**
- A **stateful application** is an application that **maintains its state** across different sessions, meaning it remembers
data and context from one operation to the next.
- StatefulSets manage stateful applications where each pod requires a unique identity and dedicated storage. Unlike Deployments, StatefulSets maintain stable network identities and persistent storage for pods.

### **1.2 Key Features of StatefulSets:**
- **Unique Pod Identifiers:** Each pod created by a StatefulSet gets a unique identifier (e.g., pod-0, pod-1, pod-2).
- **Persistent Storage:** StatefulSets use Persistent Volumes (PVs) to ensure each pod retains its data, even after restarts.
- **Ordered Deployment and Scaling:** Pods are started, scaled, and terminated in a defined order.

### **1.3 What are Deployments?**
Deployments manage stateless applications where all pods are identical and interchangeable. They ensure high availability and easy scaling by treating pods as identical replicas.

### **1.4 Differences Between StatefulSets and Deployments:**
| Feature               | StatefulSets                  | Deployments             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Pod Identity**      | Unique for each pod           | Identical for all pods  |
| **Storage**           | Dedicated Persistent Volumes with PVC   | Shared storage (if any) |
| **Startup Sequence**  | Sequential                    | Parallel                |
| **Use Case**          | Databases, Stateful Apps       | Web Servers, APIs       |
| **Service Type**      | Headless Service ( for uniqe DNS) | Normal Service (Load balenceing) |

### **1.5 Use Cases:**
- **StatefulSets:**
  - Suitable for databases, distributed systems, or applications that require stable storage and unique pod identities.
  - Example: A Cassandra database where each node has a specific role.
- **Deployments:**
  - Ideal for stateless applications like web servers or APIs where any pod can handle requests.
  - Example: A frontend web application with multiple identical instances.

### **1.6 Example YAML Configuration:**
**StatefulSet Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "web"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.17
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### ** DEMO**
- Creating a headless dervice
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: db-service
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # This makes the service headless (no IP assignment)
  selector:
    app: my-db
  ports:
    - port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
  ```
 - Creating Statefulset
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-db
spec:
  serviceName: db-service  # Link to the headless service
  replicas: 3  # Number of replicas (PostgreSQL pods)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: database
          image: postgres
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              value: "mysecretpassword"  # Set the password for PostgreSQL
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          volumeMounts:
            - name: db-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data  # Path where the DB will store data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: db-storage
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi  # Requesting 5Gi storage for each pod
```
```sh
ping my-db-1.db-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```


## **2. Kubernetes Security and RBAC**


### **2.1 Authentication:**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users and systems that interact with the Kubernetes cluster. It verifies the identity of users and components interacting with the Kubernetes API server.
 #### **Different Authentication Methods**
**Methods:**
- Client Certificates: client certificates in Kubernetes are like ID cards that prove who you are when talking to the Kubernetes API server. Instead of using passwords or tokens, you use a certificate that is issued and trusted by Kubernetes.
  1. Create a Private Key (like making a secret key for yourself).
  2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) (like applying for an ID card).
  3. Get the Certificate Signed by Kubernetes CA (like getting approval from the authority).
  4. Tell kubectl to use this certificate for authentication.
  5. Give yourself permissions using RBAC (like telling Kubernetes what youâ€™re allowed to do).
     
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0063af38-1ea7-482b-8caf-3e7a81dcc115)
  
- Bearer Token Authentication: A Bearer Token is like a temporary passcode that you give to Kubernetes when making API requests. The 
  Kubernetes API server checks if the token is valid before allowing access.
  Get a Token (from a service account or manually).
     1. Use the Token in API requests:
     2. Use the Token in API requests:
        ```sh curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" https://<kube-apiserver>/api/v1/nodes ```
     3. Control Permissions using RBAC to grant access.
  Like Service Account Tokens
  ðŸ‘‰ Used for: Automation, API access, and CI/CD tools.
- Static Token file: allows users and service accounts (SA) to authenticate with the Kubernetes API. Configured on the API server using 
   a predefined token file. **Tokens never expire**, making them a security risk.
     1. **Create a Token File (CSV Format)**
         ```csv
        <token>,<username>,<uid>,<group>
         ```
    Example:
     ```csv
     abc123,my-user,1001,system:masters
    ```
    2. **Configure Kube-API Server**
   - Add the following flag to the kube-apiserver startup command:
     ```bash
     --token-auth-file=/etc/kubernetes/token.csv
     ```

   3. **Use the Token for API Access**
   ```bash
   curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" https://<kube-apiserver>/api/v1/nodes
   ```
   **Security Risks**
    - **Tokens never expire**, making them vulnerable if exposed.
    - No built-in rotation mechanism.
    - **Not recommended for production**; use Kubernetes RBAC with short-lived tokens instead.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
    - Allows Kubernetes to authenticate users via external identity providers.
     - Examples:
        - **Ostar 11dB**
        - **Google**
        - **Azure**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab4a467d-928c-42d3-b7dc-1981937e207b)
-  Webhook Token Authentication
 A **dynamic authentication method** where Kubernetes API server verifies tokens by calling an external webhook.
 The API server sends authentication requests to the webhook service, which decides if the token is valid. Webhook authentication allows 
   Kubernetes to **delegate authentication** to an external service.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d73eaa5-16ac-4164-bee2-3de74432da82)

  **Steps to enable Webhook Token Authentication:**
  1. Create a webhook configuration file (e.g., `token-webhook-config.yaml`).
  2. Add `--authentication-token-webhook-config-file=/path/to/token-webhook-config.yaml` to kube-apiserver.
  3. Deploy an external webhook service that validates tokens and returns authentication responses.

### **2.2 Authorization:**
Authorization determines what actions an authenticated user can perform.
Diff Authorization Mode
1. Node: Node authorization mode in Kubernetes specifically authorizes API requests made by kubelets. Kubelets must use a credential that identifies them as being in the system group, with a username of system. This mode allows kubelets to perform API operations, including read operations on services, endpoints, nodes, pods, secrets, configmaps, persistent volume claims, and persistent volumes related to pods bound to the kubelet's node. To enable the Node authorizer, start the API server with the --authorization-mode flag set to include Node. Additionally, to limit the API objects kubelets are able to write, the NodeRestriction admission plugin can be enabled by starting the apiserver with --enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,....

   To add authorization mode
   edit kube-apiserver.yaml
   --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC,ABAC
 add policyfile
--authorization-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/abac-policy.json
Need to restar server pod

2. Attribute Based Access Control(ABAC): Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is an authorization model that grants access based on attributes rather than predefined roles, allowing for more granular and context-aware access control policies. ABAC evaluates access based on the attributes of the subject (user), resource, action, and environment, making it suitable for complex and distributed environments. For example, an ABAC policy might allow read and edit access to media strategies for a user in a communications job role who represents specific business units. This approach can adapt dynamically to changes in user attributes, such as promotions or changes in department, without requiring manual updates to configuration files.
```json
{
"apiVersion": "abac.authorization.kubernetes.io/v1beta1",
"kind": "Policy",
Break 10 20pm

"spec": {
"user": "alice",
"namespace": "default",
"resource": "pods",
"readonly": true
}
}
```
    To add authorization mode
    edit kube-apiserver.yaml
    --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC,ABAC
    add policyfile
    --authorization-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/abac-policy.json
    Need to restar server pod
**Why is ABAC Less Preferred?**
- Policies are stored in a **static file**, requiring API server restarts for updates.
- **Not scalable** for large clusters.
- **RBAC is preferred** because it is **dynamic and easier to manage**. 
3. Webhook Authorisation: A **custom external service** makes authorization decisions. When a request is received:
   1 . Kubernetes sends it to an external **webhook server**.
   2 . The server **verifies the request** based on custom logic.
   3 . The server **returns allow/deny decisions**.
        - --authentication-token-webhook-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/webhook-config.yaml
        - --authentication-token-webhook-cache-ttl=5m
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: webhook-auth
cluster:
server: https://auth.example.com/validate
users:
- name: webhook-auth
contexts:
- context:
cluster: webhook-auth
user: webhook-auth
name: webhook-auth
Webhook Authorisation
current-context: webhook-auth
```
**Mechanisms:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Namespace-Level: Roles and RoleBindings
  - Cluster-Level: ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings

### **2.3 RBAC Key Concepts:**
| Concept          | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role**         | Grants access to resources within a namespace           |
| **ClusterRole**  | Grants access to resources cluster-wide                 |
| **RoleBinding**  | Binds a Role to users, groups, or service accounts      |
| **ClusterRoleBinding** | Binds a ClusterRole to users, groups, or service accounts cluster-wide |

### **2.4 RBAC Syntax Examples:**
**Role Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

**RoleBinding Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane-doe
  apiGroup: ""
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

#### Kubernetes User Setup and Cluster Configuration

### 1. **Create a Kubernetes Cluster using Kind**
```bash
kind create cluster --name dev-cluster3
```
- Creates a Kubernetes cluster named **`dev-cluster3`** using Kind.

### 2. **Generate a Private Key & Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**
```bash
openssl genrsa -out dev-user.key 2048
openssl req -new -key dev-user.key -out dev-user.csr -subj "/CN=dev-user/O=dev-group"
```
- Generates a **private key (`dev-user.key`)** for the user.
- Creates a **CSR (`dev-user.csr`)** for `dev-user` in the `dev-group`.

### 3. **Encode CSR in Base64 and Store it**
```bash
CSR_CONTENT=$(cat dev-user.csr | base64 | tr -d '/n')
echo $CSR_CONTENT
```
- Encodes the CSR in **Base64** (required for Kubernetes CSR request).
- Stores the encoded CSR in the variable `CSR_CONTENT`.

### 4. **Create & Apply the CertificateSigningRequest (CSR)**
```bash
vi certificatesiginingrequesst.yaml
kubectl apply -f certificatesiginingrequesst.yaml
```
- **Creates a Kubernetes CSR** (`certificatesiginingrequesst.yaml`) with `CSR_CONTENT`.
- **Submits CSR request** to Kubernetes using `kubectl apply`.

### 5. **Configure `kubectl` for `dev-user`**
```bash
kubectl config set-credentials dev-user --client-certificate=dev-user.crt --client-key=dev-user.key
kubectl config set-context dev-user-context1 --cluster=kind-dev-cluster3 --user=dev-user
```
- Configures `kubectl` to use `dev-user` with the issued certificate.
- Creates a new Kubernetes context named **`dev-user-context1`**.

### 6. **Verify Cluster Access and Pod Creation**
```bash
kubectl run test-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never
kubectl get pods
```
- Runs a test pod using **Nginx** to check permissions.
- Checks the list of running pods.

### 7. **Switch Context and Re-Test Access**
```bash
kubectx dev-user-context1
kubectl get pods
kubectl run test-pod --image=nginx --restart=Never
```
- Switches context to `dev-user-context1`.
- Tries to list and create pods, verifying `RBAC` permissions.

## **Outcome**
- A Kubernetes cluster (`dev-cluster3`) is created.
- A **new user (`dev-user`)** is added with a private key and signed certificate.
- Kubernetes **CSR is generated, approved, and assigned to `dev-user`**.
- `kubectl` is configured to use `dev-user`.
- Access permissions are tested using a **test pod**.



### **2.5 Best Practices:**
- Follow the principle of least privilege to minimize risks.
- Regularly review and audit RBAC policies.
- Use namespace isolation to restrict access boundaries.

---
## **Security Context**
Security contexts are settings applied to Pods and containers to define privilege and access control settings.
 - **Pod level**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: secure-pod
spec:
securityContext: # Security settings apply to all containers in the Pod
runAsUser: 1000
kube
config
certificate key dev user
cluster
Context
cluster t user
Security Contexts
Pod level
Container level
Pod level
runAsGroup: 1000
fsGroup: 1000
containers:
- name: app-container
image: nginx
```
- **container Level**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: secure-container
spec:
containers:
- name: app-container
image: nginx
securityContext: # Only applies to this container
runAsUser: 2000
readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  ```
#### **Key Security Context Fields**
1. Runasuser and runasgroup
```yaml
securityContext:
runAsUser: 1000 # Runs as non-root user with UID 1000
runAsGroup: 3000 # Uses GID 3000
```
2. Priviledged
```yaml
securityContext:
privileged: true # Grants full access to the host
```
3. Allow Priviledge Escalation
```yaml
Blocking Privilege Escalation
securityContext:
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
4. Read only file system
```yaml
ecurityContext:
readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```
5. Linux priviledge
```yaml
securityContext:
capabilities:
add: ["NET_ADMIN"] # Allows changing network settings
drop: ["ALL"] # Drops all unnecessary capabilities
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: secure-pod
spec:
securityContext: # Applies to all containers in the pod
runAsUser: 1000 # Runs as non-root user
runAsGroup: 3000 # Group ID for security
fsGroup: 2000 # Ensures correct file permissions
containers:
- name: secure-container
image: busybox
securityContext:
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false # Prevent privilege escalation
readOnlyRootFilesystem: true # Prevents modifying root FS
command: ["sleep", "3600"]
```
## **3. Summary Commands**


### **3.1 Authentication and Authorization Commands:**
- `kubectl get pods` - List all pods in a namespace.
- `kubectl delete pods <pod-name>` - Delete a specific pod.
- `kubectl describe roles` - Describe defined RBAC roles within a namespace.
