## **1. StatefulSets and Deployment**


### **1.1 What are StatefulSets?**
- A **stateful application** is an application that **maintains its state** across different sessions, meaning it remembers
data and context from one operation to the next.
- StatefulSets manage stateful applications where each pod requires a unique identity and dedicated storage. Unlike Deployments, StatefulSets maintain stable network identities and persistent storage for pods.

### **1.2 Key Features of StatefulSets:**
- **Unique Pod Identifiers:** Each pod created by a StatefulSet gets a unique identifier (e.g., pod-0, pod-1, pod-2).
- **Persistent Storage:** StatefulSets use Persistent Volumes (PVs) to ensure each pod retains its data, even after restarts.
- **Ordered Deployment and Scaling:** Pods are started, scaled, and terminated in a defined order.

### **1.3 What are Deployments?**
Deployments manage stateless applications where all pods are identical and interchangeable. They ensure high availability and easy scaling by treating pods as identical replicas.

### **1.4 Differences Between StatefulSets and Deployments:**
| Feature               | StatefulSets                  | Deployments             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Pod Identity**      | Unique for each pod           | Identical for all pods  |
| **Storage**           | Dedicated Persistent Volumes with PVC   | Shared storage (if any) |
| **Startup Sequence**  | Sequential                    | Parallel                |
| **Use Case**          | Databases, Stateful Apps       | Web Servers, APIs       |
| **Service Type**      | Headless Service ( for uniqe DNS) | Normal Service (Load balenceing) |

### **1.5 Use Cases:**
- **StatefulSets:**
  - Suitable for databases, distributed systems, or applications that require stable storage and unique pod identities.
  - Example: A Cassandra database where each node has a specific role.
- **Deployments:**
  - Ideal for stateless applications like web servers or APIs where any pod can handle requests.
  - Example: A frontend web application with multiple identical instances.

### **1.6 Example YAML Configuration:**
**StatefulSet Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "web"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.17
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### ** DEMO**
- Creating a headless dervice
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: db-service
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # This makes the service headless (no IP assignment)
  selector:
    app: my-db
  ports:
    - port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
  ```
 - Creating Statefulset
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-db
spec:
  serviceName: db-service  # Link to the headless service
  replicas: 3  # Number of replicas (PostgreSQL pods)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-db
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-db
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: database
          image: postgres
          env:
            - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
              value: "mysecretpassword"  # Set the password for PostgreSQL
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5432
          volumeMounts:
            - name: db-storage
              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data  # Path where the DB will store data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: db-storage
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi  # Requesting 5Gi storage for each pod
```
```sh
ping my-db-1.db-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```


## **2. Kubernetes Security and RBAC**


### **2.1 Authentication:**
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users and systems that interact with the Kubernetes cluster. It verifies the identity of users and components interacting with the Kubernetes API server.
 #### **Different Authentication Methods**
**Methods:**
- Client Certificates: client certificates in Kubernetes are like ID cards that prove who you are when talking to the Kubernetes API server. Instead of using passwords or tokens, you use a certificate that is issued and trusted by Kubernetes.
  1. Create a Private Key (like making a secret key for yourself).
  2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) (like applying for an ID card).
  3. Get the Certificate Signed by Kubernetes CA (like getting approval from the authority).
  4. Tell kubectl to use this certificate for authentication.
  5. Give yourself permissions using RBAC (like telling Kubernetes what youâ€™re allowed to do).

- Bearer Token Authentication: A Bearer Token is like a temporary passcode that you give to Kubernetes when making API requests. The 
  Kubernetes API server checks if the token is valid before allowing access.
  Get a Token (from a service account or manually).
     1. Use the Token in API requests:
     2. Use the Token in API requests:
        ```sh curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" https://<kube-apiserver>/api/v1/nodes ```
     3. Control Permissions using RBAC to grant access.
  Like Service Account Tokens
  ðŸ‘‰ Used for: Automation, API access, and CI/CD tools.
- Static Token file: allows users and service accounts (SA) to authenticate with the Kubernetes API. Configured on the API server using 
   a predefined token file. **Tokens never expire**, making them a security risk.
     1. **Create a Token File (CSV Format)**
         ```csv
        <token>,<username>,<uid>,<group>
         ```
    Example:
     ```csv
     abc123,my-user,1001,system:masters
    ```
    2. **Configure Kube-API Server**
   - Add the following flag to the kube-apiserver startup command:
     ```bash
     --token-auth-file=/etc/kubernetes/token.csv
     ```

   3. **Use the Token for API Access**
   ```bash
   curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" https://<kube-apiserver>/api/v1/nodes
   ```
   **Security Risks**
    - **Tokens never expire**, making them vulnerable if exposed.
    - No built-in rotation mechanism.
    - **Not recommended for production**; use Kubernetes RBAC with short-lived tokens instead.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
    - Allows Kubernetes to authenticate users via external identity providers.
     - Examples:
        - **Ostar 11dB**
        - **Google**
        - **Azure**

-  Webhook Token Authentication
 A **dynamic authentication method** where Kubernetes API server verifies tokens by calling an external webhook.
 The API server sends authentication requests to the webhook service, which decides if the token is valid. Webhook authentication allows 
   Kubernetes to **delegate authentication** to an external service.
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d73eaa5-16ac-4164-bee2-3de74432da82)

  **Steps to enable Webhook Token Authentication:**
  1. Create a webhook configuration file (e.g., `token-webhook-config.yaml`).
  2. Add `--authentication-token-webhook-config-file=/path/to/token-webhook-config.yaml` to kube-apiserver.
  3. Deploy an external webhook service that validates tokens and returns authentication responses.

### **2.2 Authorization:**
Authorization determines what actions an authenticated user can perform.

**Mechanisms:**
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Namespace-Level: Roles and RoleBindings
  - Cluster-Level: ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings

### **2.3 RBAC Key Concepts:**
| Concept          | Description                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Role**         | Grants access to resources within a namespace           |
| **ClusterRole**  | Grants access to resources cluster-wide                 |
| **RoleBinding**  | Binds a Role to users, groups, or service accounts      |
| **ClusterRoleBinding** | Binds a ClusterRole to users, groups, or service accounts cluster-wide |

### **2.4 RBAC Syntax Examples:**
**Role Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

**RoleBinding Example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane-doe
  apiGroup: ""
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### **2.5 Best Practices:**
- Follow the principle of least privilege to minimize risks.
- Regularly review and audit RBAC policies.
- Use namespace isolation to restrict access boundaries.
