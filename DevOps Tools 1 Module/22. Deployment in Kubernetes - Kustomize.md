## Kustomize

### What is Kustomize?
Kustomize is a **Kubernetes-native configuration management tool** that allows you to customize Kubernetes resource YAML files without modifying the original files. It dynamically applies configurations at runtime, making it easier to maintain multiple environment configurations, such as development, staging, and production.

- It follows a **layered approach** where you define **a base configuration** and apply **environment-specific overlays**
without duplication.
- Kustomize allows you to **overlay configurations** for different environments (dev, staging, production) without altering
the original files.

---

### Working with Kustomize

#### Pre-existing YAML Files:
- You typically start with Kubernetes resource files:
  - `deployment.yaml`
  - `service.yaml`
  - `configmap.yaml`

#### Adding Kustomize:
1. Create a new file named **`kustomization.yaml`**.
2. Add your existing resource files to this file. For example:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     - deployment.yaml
     - service.yaml
   ```
3. Kustomize dynamically applies the configurations defined in the `kustomization.yaml` file to your original resource files **at runtime**.

#### Running Kustomize:
Use the following commands to execute Kustomize:
- **View transformed YAML**: 
  `kubectl kustomize .`
- **Apply configurations directly to your cluster**: 
  `kubectl apply -k .`
- **Chain commands for flexibility**: 
  `kubectl kustomize . | kubectl apply -f`

---

### Demonstration (Instructor Focus)

**Steps to demonstrate Kustomize:**
1. Create a `kustomization.yaml` file in the same directory as your resource files.
2. Show how parameters in the `kustomization.yaml` file are applied dynamically to existing files.
3. Explain the command outputs and how they affect the Kubernetes cluster.

Example `kustomization.yaml` file:
```yaml
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
```

### Organizing Kustomize with Directories

To manage environment-specific configurations, use the following directory structure:

#### Directory Structure:
- **`base` directory**:
  - Contains common YAML files, such as:
    - `deployment.yaml`
    - `service.yaml`
    - `configmap.yaml`
    - `kustomization.yaml`
- **`overlays` directory**:
  - Contains environment-specific configurations:
    - `dev/`
    - `staging/`
    - `prod/`

#### Example:
1. Move all base resources (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.) into the `base` directory.
2. In each environment folder under `overlays`, create a `kustomization.yaml` file that references the base directory:
   ```yaml
   resources:
     - ../../base
   ```
3. Apply patches for specific environments using **`patchesStrategicMerge`**:
   - Add a new file `deployment-patch.yaml` inside the specific environment folder.
   - Reference this file in the `kustomization.yaml` for the environment:
     ```yaml
     patchesStrategicMerge:
       - deployment-patch.yaml
     ```

#### Applying the Configuration:
- To apply the dev configuration:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k overlays/dev/
  ```

## Understanding Kustomize Terminologies

### Directory Structure:
1. **Base Directory**:
   - Contains shared resources for all environments.
   - Files:
     - `base-deployment.yaml`
     - `kustomization.yaml`
2. **Overlays Directory**:
   - Contains environment-specific configurations.
   - Files:
     - `kustomization.yaml`
     - `patch.yaml`

### Key Features of `kustomization.yaml`:
- **ConfigMap Generator**:
  Dynamically generate ConfigMaps:
  ```yaml
  configMapGenerator:
    - name: my-configmap
      literals:
        - key=value
  ```
- **Secret Generator**:
  Similar to ConfigMap generator but for secrets:
  ```yaml
  secretGenerator:
  ```
- **Common Labels and Annotations**:
  Add labels/annotations globally:
  ```yaml
  commonLabels:
    app: my-app
  ```
- **Cross-cutting Fields**:
  Fields like common labels, annotations, or namespaces defined in the `kustomization.yaml` file will apply across all resources.

### Patching Options:
  In **Kustomize**, patches are used to **modify existing Kubernetes resources** (like Deployments, Services,
  ConfigMaps) without changing the original `base` manifests
- ### **Strategic Merge Patches**:
  Use the `patchesStrategicMerge` field to define YAML patches that selectively modify base resources.
    - **Modifies fields in existing resources.**
    - Used for **small, selective updates** to a resource.
    - **Does not require full resource definition**—only specify fields to update.

- ### **JSON Patches**:
   **Kubernetes JSON Patch (RFC 6902) with Kustomize**  
   **JSON Patch** is a format for applying updates to a JSON document. It defines operations like:  

    - **add** → Inserts a value at a specified path.  
    - **replace** → Updates an existing value.  
    - **remove** → Deletes a value from the document.  
    - **move** → Relocates a value within the document.  
    - **copy** → Duplicates a value from one location to another.  
    - **test** → Checks if a value exists before applying changes.  

These operations are applied in a sequence to modify JSON data without replacing the entire object.

## kustomization.yaml  
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - ../../base  # Reference to base manifests

patchesJson6902:
  - target:
      group: apps
      version: v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
    path: patch-env.json  # JSON patch file for environment variables
  - target:
      group: apps
      version: v1
      kind: Deployment
      name: my-app
    path: patch-image.json  # JSON patch file for image update
```

---

## patch-env.json (Add Environment Variable)  
This patch **adds an environment variable (`ENV=production`)** to the first container in the deployment.  

```json
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/-",
    "value": {
      "name": "ENV",
      "value": "production"
    }
  }
]
```

---

## patch-image.json (Update Container Image)  
This patch **updates the container image** to `my-app:latest`.  

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/image",
    "value": "my-app:latest"
  }
]
```

---

## Apply the Patch  
To apply the patches using Kustomize, run the following command:  

```sh
kubectl apply -k .
```
This will update the deployment with the new environment variable and image version.  



### Variables:
Kustomize supports variables using the `$` syntax.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29db9fca-5fc0-4f0c-aa49-851f10cab818)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - service.yaml
  - deployment.yaml

vars:
  - name: SERVICE_NAME
    objref:
      kind: Service
      version: v1
      name: my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 2
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: nginx:latest
          env:
            - name: SERVICE_URL
              value: "$(SERVICE_NAME)"  # Using the variable
```

## Kustomize Examples

### Scenario 1: Multi-Datacenter Deployment
Suppose a company has four datacenters running an Nginx application. The environments are:
- Preview
- Sales
- Production

#### Configuration:
1. The **base directory** contains common Kubernetes resources:
   - Deployments
   - Services
   - ConfigMaps
2. Each datacenter has environment-specific configurations, including:
   - Environment variables
   - Secrets
   - Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
   - Role-based Access Control (RBAC) roles

Kustomize enables you to define the shared resources in the **base** directory and override environment-specific values in the respective **overlay** directories.

---

### Real-Life Example:
Consider a scenario with multiple clusters spread across different AWS regions. The challenges include:
- Managing **compliance issues**.
- Supporting **multi-tenancy** for different customers.
- Enabling **region-specific features**.

Kustomize simplifies this by:
- Providing a common base configuration for all clusters.
- Allowing region-specific customizations using overlays.

---

## Helm vs Kustomize

### Comparison Table:

| Feature          | **Helm**                              | **Kustomize**                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Type**         | Package Manager for Kubernetes        | Kubernetes Native Configuration Tool   |
| **Templating**   | Yes (with Go templates)               | No                                     |
| **Overlays**     | Uses values files for customization   | Uses patch-based overlays              |
| **Releases**     | Manages lifecycle (install/upgrade)   | Doesn’t manage state, just config      |
| **Dependencies** | Supports chart dependencies           | No built-in support                    |
| **Complexity**   | Can be complex for simple cases       | Simpler, focuses on YAML transformation|
| **Community**    | Large ecosystem (charts)              | Part of Kubernetes (kubectl integration)|
| **Versioning**   | Yes                                   | No, relies on Git for version control  |

### Key Takeaways:
- **Helm**: Ideal for managing complex applications with lifecycle management.
- **Kustomize**: Best for lightweight YAML transformations without requiring templating.
