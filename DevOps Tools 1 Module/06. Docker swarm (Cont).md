# **What is Docker Swarm?**

Docker Swarm is a **container orchestration tool** built into Docker that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a **single system**. It handles tasks such as:  
- **Managing container instances**  
- **Scaling services up or down**  
- **Load balancing**  
- **Monitoring container health**  

**Comparison with Kubernetes:**  
Both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes provide **container orchestration**, but Kubernetes offers **more advanced features** and **greater scalability** at the cost of increased complexity.

---

### **Understanding Container Orchestration**  
Container orchestration tools like **Docker Swarm** and **Kubernetes** help manage multiple containers by deciding:  
- How many containers to run  
- Where to run them  
- When to start or stop containers  
- How to allocate CPU and memory  

**Analogy:**  
Think of Docker Swarm as a **hotel manager** who assigns **chefs (containers)** to fulfill customer orders based on availability and load.

---

# **Architecture of Docker Swarm**

Docker Swarm operates in a **distributed cluster** model with the following components:

### **1. Swarm Manager**
- Acts as the **brain** of the Docker Swarm.  
- **Orchestrates** all the containers running in the cluster.  
- Manages **service discovery**, **load balancing**, and **health monitoring**.  

**Responsibilities of the Swarm Manager:**  
- **Scheduling Services**: Assigns tasks to worker nodes.  
- **Health Monitoring**: Ensures that all services are running smoothly.  
- **Scaling**: Dynamically scales services based on demand.  
- **Service Discovery**: Keeps track of all nodes in the cluster.  
  - When a node joins or leaves the cluster, it automatically updates the cluster state.

---

### **2. Worker Nodes**  
- **Execute tasks** assigned by the Swarm Manager.  
- Run the actual **containers** in the cluster.  
- Regularly **report their status** back to the manager.

---

### **Swarm Manager Election Process**  
- **Multiple managers** can exist in a swarm.  
- Managers undergo an **election process** to elect a **leader**.  
- The **leader** acts as the **first point of contact** for managing the swarm.

# **Key Features of Docker Swarm**

| **Feature**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clustering**        | Groups multiple Docker containers into a single cluster for easy management.     |
| **Service Definition** | Allows defining **services** as tasks that run on the swarm.                    |
| **Load Balancing**     | Distributes network traffic across multiple containers in a service.            |
| **Service Discovery**  | Tracks nodes and services, ensuring seamless scaling and updates.               |
| **Rolling Updates**    | Allows updating services with minimal or no downtime.                           |
| **High Availability**  | Ensures services remain available even if a node fails.                         |

---

### **Rolling Updates Example:**  
If a service has **three containers**, Docker Swarm updates them **one by one** to avoid downtime:  
1. The first container updates while the other two remain the same.  
2. The second container updates after the first is successful.  
3. Finally, the third container updates.

# **Difference Between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes**

| **Property**           | **Docker Swarm**                             | **Kubernetes**                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**         | Very Simple                                  | More complex                                   |
| **Fault Tolerance**     | Basic fault tolerance                        | Advanced with self-healing capabilities        |
| **Scalability**         | Limited                                      | Highly scalable                                |
| **Load Balancing**      | Basic load balancing between containers      | Advanced load balancing and traffic routing    |
| **Security**            | Basic TLS                                    | Advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)      |
| **Deployment Options**  | Rolling update and rollback                 | Canary, rolling updates with granular control  |

# **Practical Demonstration of Docker Swarm**

### **Steps to Set Up Docker Swarm:**

1. **Initialize the Swarm**  
   ```bash
   docker swarm init
   ```
   - Note the **manager IP** and **join token** from the output.

2. **Check Swarm Status**  
   ```bash
   docker node ls
   ```
   - Lists all the nodes in the swarm.

3. **Add a Worker Node**  
   Run the **join command** from another terminal or server to add a worker node:  
   ```bash
   docker swarm join --token <join_token> <manager_ip>
   ```

4. **Create a Service**  
   ```bash
   docker service create --name my_service --replicas 3 nginx
   ```

---

# **Configuring Swarm Nodes**

### **Types of Nodes:**
1. **Manager Nodes**  
   - Must be an **odd number** to ensure a clear election process.  
2. **Worker Nodes**  
   - Perform tasks assigned by the manager.

---

### **Managing Nodes:**

| **Command**                  | **Description**                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `docker node promote <id>`    | Promotes a worker node to a manager.          |
| `docker node demote <id>`     | Demotes a manager node to a worker.           |
| `docker node update --availability <state> <id>` | Updates the nodeâ€™s availability. |

### **Node States:**
| **State**     | **Description**                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Active**    | Default state, accepting new tasks.                              |
| **Pause**     | Temporarily halts task scheduling, but keeps running tasks.      |
| **Drain**     | Prevents new tasks and migrates existing tasks to other nodes.   |

---

### **Pausing and Draining Nodes**

- **Pause a node:**  
   ```bash
   docker node update --availability pause <node_id>
   ```
- **Drain a node:**  
   ```bash
   docker node update --availability drain <node_id>
   ```

---

# **Backup in Docker Swarm**

Docker Swarm stores its state in the **Raft Database**, replicated across all manager nodes.

### **Backup Steps:**
1. **Stop Docker**  
   ```bash
   systemctl stop docker
   ```
2. **Backup the Raft Database**  
   Copy the database from:  
   ```bash
   /var/lib/docker/swarm/raft
   ```
3. **Save the Backup**  
   Copy the database to a secure location.

---

# **Modes in Docker Swarm**

### **Autolock Mode:**
- Lock the swarm to **prevent unauthorized nodes** from joining.  
   ```bash
   docker swarm update --autolock=true
   ```
- **Unlock the swarm**:  
   ```bash
   docker swarm unlock
   ```

---

# **High Availability in Docker Swarm**

Docker Swarm provides **high availability** through:  
1. **Node Management**  
   - Ensure an **odd number** of manager nodes for consistent leader elections.  

2. **Service Replication**  
   - Replicate services across nodes to ensure continuous availability.

3. **Health Checks**  
   - Use **healthcheck** to monitor container health:  
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080"]
     interval: 30s
     timeout: 10s
     retries: 3
   ```
