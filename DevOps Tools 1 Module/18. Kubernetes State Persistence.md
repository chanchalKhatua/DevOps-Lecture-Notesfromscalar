## Network Policies



### **Overview:**
Network policies define rules for how pods communicate with:
- Each other.
- External endpoints.

Policies can manage both **ingress** (incoming traffic) and **egress** (outgoing traffic).

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Selectors:**
   - Used to identify the pods to which the policy applies.
   - Example: A policy might target pods labeled `app=frontend`.
   - **Example:** Consider a microservices architecture where you only want the `frontend` pod to communicate with the `backend` pod but restrict it from accessing the `database` pod. Using selectors, you can define this scope effectively.

2. **Ingress Rules:**
   - Define the allowed incoming traffic to pods.
   - Example: Allow HTTP traffic on port 80 from a specific pod group.
   - **Example:** If a `shopping-cart` pod accepts traffic from a `user-session` pod, the ingress rule can specify that only requests on port 8080 (HTTP) are allowed while blocking others.

3. **Egress Rules:**
   - Define the allowed outgoing traffic from pods.
   - Example: Allow outgoing requests to a database pod.
   - **Example:** A `logging` pod might need to send data to an external monitoring service. The egress rule can restrict traffic to only the specific IP address of that service.

4. **Policy Types:**
   - **Ingress:** Rules for incoming traffic.
   - **Egress:** Rules for outgoing traffic.
   - Both can be used simultaneously to create comprehensive traffic policies.

### **Lab Workflow:**
1. **Deploy an Application:**
   - Example: Deploy a web application that communicates with a database pod.
   - **Example:** Deploy a `frontend` service that interacts with both a `backend` service and a `cache` service while limiting communication to specific ports and protocols.

2. **Deploy a Second Pod with Specific Policies:**
   - Create a pod with policies to allow only certain traffic.
   - Example: Deploy a monitoring pod that only listens to logs from the application pod.

3. **Create an Allow Policy:**
   - Example: Permit HTTP traffic from pod `frontend` to pod `backend`.
   - **Example:** Create a policy to allow TCP connections from a `worker` pod to a `queue` pod only on port 5672 for message queueing.

4. **Create a Deny Policy:**
   - Example: Block all other traffic except necessary requests.
   - **Example:** Deny all outbound traffic from a `debug` pod except for SSH connections to a specific admin server.

## Volumes in Kubernetes



### **Types of Volumes:**
1. **ConfigMap as Volume:**
   - Mount configuration data as files or environment variables.
   - Example: Store database connection strings in a `ConfigMap` and use it in pods.
   - **Detailed Example:** A `ConfigMap` containing multiple configurations (e.g., environment-specific variables for dev, staging, and production) can be mounted as a volume, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  database_url: "mysql://db.example.com:3306"
  max_connections: "100"
  app-config.json: |
    {
      "log_level": "debug",
      "retry_count": 5
    }

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: busybox
      command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config-volume
          mountPath: /config
  volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      configMap:
        name: app-config
```

2. **Secret as Volume:**
   - Store sensitive data like passwords or tokens securely.
   - Example: Mount an API token secret as a volume.
   - **Example:** Use a `Secret` to store TLS certificates for a secure connection between pods.

3. **HostPath:**
   - Maps a directory or file on the host nodeâ€™s filesystem to a pod.
   - Example: Use host paths to share logs between the host and pod.
   - **Example:** Map a specific directory, such as `/var/logs/app`, from the host node to a pod for real-time log monitoring.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hostpath-demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: busybox
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
      args:
        - while true; do
            echo "$(date) - Log entry from pod" >> /var/log/app-logs/demo.log;
            sleep 5;
          done
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/log/app-logs
          name: host-volume
  volumes:
    - name: host-volume
      hostPath:
        path: /var/log/app-logs  # Host directory to be mounted
        type: DirectoryOrCreate  # Creates the directory if it does not exist

```
4. **EmptyDir:**
    ## Overview
`emptyDir` is a temporary volume type in Kubernetes that is created when a pod starts and exists as long as the pod runs. When the pod is deleted, the data inside the `emptyDir` is lost.

A temporary directory is created when a pod is assigned to a node. The data is cleared when the pod stops.

## Key Features
### Ephemeral Storage
- The `emptyDir` volume is created when a pod starts.
- The data is lost when the pod is deleted.

###  Persistence Across Container Restarts
- If a container inside the pod restarts, the `emptyDir` data remains intact.
- If the pod is deleted, the `emptyDir` is also removed.

###  Shared Storage Between Containers
- Multiple containers within the same pod can use `emptyDir` to share data.

###  Temporary Storage
- Ideal for caching, temporary logs, or intermediate data processing.
- Example: Cache data processing results temporarily.
- Example: Use `emptyDir` for temporary storage in a data analytics pipeline where intermediate results need to be processed within the same pod lifecycle.

###  Performance Optimization
- When configured with `{ medium: "Memory" }`, `emptyDir` stores data in RAM instead of disk, making it **very fast**.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    emptyDir:
      medium: "Memory"
  ```

## Example Pod Definition Using `emptyDir`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo "logging $(date)" >> /opt/logs.txt; sleep 1; done']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data
      mountPath: /opt
  - name: logshipper
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -F /opt/logs.txt']
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data
      mountPath: /opt
  volumes:
  - name: data
    emptyDir: {}
```

## Persistent Volumes (PV), Claims (PVC), and Storage Classes



### **Persistent Volumes (PV):**
- **Independent of Pod Lifecycle:** Persistent storage remains even after pod deletion.
- **Access Modes:**
  - **ReadWriteOnce:** Mounted by a single node for read/write.
  - **ReadOnlyMany:** Mounted by multiple nodes as read-only.
  - **ReadWriteMany:** Mounted by multiple nodes for read/write.

#### **Reclaim Policies:**
- **Retain:** Keeps the data for manual reclamation.
- **Recycle:** Performs a basic cleanup (e.g., deleting files).
- **Delete:** Deletes the data when the volume is released.

### **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):**
- A request for storage by a pod.
- **Dynamic Provisioning:** Automatically provisions a PV when a PVC is created.

### **Storage Class:**
1. **Provisioner:** The backend storage responsible for provisioning.
2. **Parameters:** Define properties like storage size or type.
3. **Reclaim Policy:** Configured at the storage class level.

#### **Example Workflow:**
1. Define a **Storage Class** with specific parameters.
   - Example: Create a storage class for SSD-backed storage with high IOPS for database workloads.
2. Create a **PVC** to request storage from the defined class.
   - Example: Request a 10GB volume with `ReadWriteMany` access mode for shared access.
3. Automatically provision a **PV** based on the request.
4. Mount the PV to the pod for data persistence.
   - Example: Mount a dynamically provisioned PV to a MySQL pod for data storage.

## Quality of Service (QoS)



### **Goals:**
- Efficient resource management.
- Classify workloads based on resource requests and limits.

### **QoS Classes:**
1. **Guaranteed:**
   - Resources are fully reserved for the pod.
   - Example: A pod with exact resource requests and limits specified.
   - **Example:** Deploy a critical financial transaction processing pod with CPU and memory requests of 2 cores and 4GB respectively, ensuring consistent performance.

2. **Burstable:**
   - Some resource limits are set, but the pod can exceed requests.
   - Example: A pod with higher limits than requests.
   - **Example:** A `logging` pod with 500m CPU and 1GB memory requests but limits of 1 CPU and 2GB memory can burst when additional resources are available.

3. **BestEffort:**
   - No resource limits or requests specified.
   - Example: A pod that consumes resources only if available.
   - **Example:** Deploy an auxiliary data analysis pod without resource reservations, utilizing idle cluster resources.
