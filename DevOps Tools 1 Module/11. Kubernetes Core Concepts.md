## Why Kubernetes?

### Key Points:
- Kubernetes is abbreviated as **K8s**, with 8 letters between K and s.
- Evolution:
  1. Physical Machines: One application per machine.
  2. Virtual Machines (VMs): Multiple isolated applications per physical machine.
  3. Containers: Running multiple independent applications within VMs using Dockerization.
- Challenges with Scaling:
  - Increased number of containers leads to increased complexity.
  - Orchestration became necessary to manage containers.
- Kubernetes (K8s):
  - Acts as a **container orchestration tool**.
  - Dynamically assigns resources (containers) based on demand, e.g., in an e-commerce platform.

### üöÄ Why Kubernetes Comes into the Picture?

1. **Central Controller (Control Plane)**  
   Kubernetes provides a centralized control plane that manages cluster resources, scheduling, and orchestration of containers. It ensures that the desired state of applications is maintained.

2. **Scalability**  
   Kubernetes allows you to **easily scale applications** up or down based on demand ‚Äî whether that's handling traffic spikes or saving resources during low usage.

3. **Scale More Nodes**  
   It supports **horizontal scaling** by adding more worker nodes to the cluster, enabling high availability and performance for large-scale applications.

4. **Scale In Nodes (Cost Efficient)**  
   Kubernetes also supports **scaling down** nodes when they're not needed, helping reduce infrastructure costs ‚Äî especially in cloud environments using autoscaling.

5. **Health Monitoring**  
   Kubernetes constantly **monitors the health** of pods and nodes. If a container fails or becomes unresponsive, it automatically restarts or replaces it to maintain availability.

6. **Portability**  
   Kubernetes is **cloud-agnostic** ‚Äî you can deploy your workloads on AWS, Azure, GCP, or even on-premises without changing much. It ensures **consistency across environments**.

## Kubernetes (K8s) Architecture

### Overview:
- Divided into:
  - **Control Plane**
  - **Worker Nodes**

**Kubernetes Core Concepts and Components Explained**

---

### 1. Pod - Smallest Unit of Deployment in Kubernetes
A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process and can contain one or more containers. Containers within a pod share the same network namespace, storage, and specifications, and are scheduled on the same node. Pods ensure that closely coupled application components are deployed together.

---

### 2. Kube API Server
The **Kube API Server** acts as the frontend and central management entity of the Kubernetes control plane.
- All interactions with the cluster (e.g., kubectl, CI/CD tools) go through the API server.
- It handles **authentication**, **authorization**, **admission control**, and **API validation**.

---

### 3. Scheduler
The **Kubernetes Scheduler** is responsible for assigning nodes to newly created pods based on available resources and scheduling policies.
- It ensures workload distribution across the cluster.
- Factors considered: node resources, labels, affinities, taints/tolerations, etc.

---

### 4. Controller Manager
The **Kube Controller Manager** runs various controllers that continuously regulate the state of the cluster:

- **Node Controller**:
  - Monitors the health of nodes.
  - Marks a node as unavailable if it stops responding.
  - Removes pods from failed nodes after a timeout.

- **Replication Controller**:
  - Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are always running.
  - Creates or deletes pods to maintain the desired state.

- **Endpoint Controller**:
  - Manages the `Endpoints` object, linking Services to Pods using Pod IPs.

- **Service Account & Token Controller**:
  - Automatically creates default service accounts and their associated tokens for each namespace.

- **Namespace Controller**:
  - Manages the lifecycle of namespaces.
  - Cleans up resources like pods and services in a namespace marked for deletion.

- **Persistent Volume (PV) Controller**:
  - Manages persistent volume provisioning and binding.
  - Handles the lifecycle of PVs and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

- **Job Controller**:
  - Manages batch jobs.
  - Ensures successful execution and clean-up after completion.

---

### 5. etcd - Cluster Data Store
**etcd** is a high-performance, distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster-related data.
- Kubernetes stores:
  - **Cluster state**: Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets
  - **Configuration data**: Resource quotas, roles, policies
  - **Metadata**: Timestamps, labels, annotations
  - **Leader election**: Ensures only one controller manager is active
- Only the **leader node** writes to etcd. Data is then replicated to other master nodes.
- Etcd ensures consistency, fault tolerance, and durability.

---

### 6. Cloud Controller Manager
The **Cloud Controller Manager** integrates Kubernetes with underlying cloud providers.
- Manages cloud-specific components (e.g., load balancers, storage volumes).
- Handles:
  - Node discovery
  - Cloud resource cleanup
  - Route configuration

---

### 7. Kubelet
The **Kubelet** is an agent that runs on each worker node.
It ensures that containers in pods are running and healthy according to the PodSpec.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Pod Lifecycle Management**:
  - Communicates with API Server to receive pod definitions.
  - Starts and monitors containers via container runtime.

- **Node Status Reporting**:
  - Reports node conditions (Ready, MemoryPressure, DiskPressure, etc.) to the API server.

- **Resource Management**:
  - Enforces CPU/memory requests and limits.
  - Manages Quality of Service (QoS) classes.

- **Pod Volume Management**:
  - Mounts/unmounts persistent storage volumes to containers.

- **Logging and Metrics**:
  - Provides metrics via cAdvisor.
  - Supplies logs and monitoring data.

- **Secrets and ConfigMaps**:
  - Pulls sensitive data from API server and injects into containers.

---

### 8. Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
The **CRI** allows Kubernetes to support multiple container runtimes. Examples include containerd, CRI-O, and Docker.

**Example config:**  
```bash
KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--container-runtime=remote --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```

The Kubelet interacts with the container runtime through CRI to manage container lifecycle.

---

### 9. KubeProxy
**KubeProxy** is the network proxy that runs on each node.
- It manages the network rules for communication between services and pods.
- Supports both **iptables** and **IPVS** modes for traffic routing.
- Ensures seamless service discovery and load balancing within the cluster.

## üåê Types of Kubernetes Setups

### 1. **Vanilla Kubernetes**
- Pure upstream Kubernetes without any vendor-specific customization.
- Installed and managed by the user (self-managed clusters).

## üìÑ Kubeconfig & Context

- `KUBECONFIG` can point to multiple config files:  
  ```bash
  export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/config1:/path/to/config2
  ```

### **Kubeconfig File Sections**
- **clusters** ‚Äì cluster definitions
- **users** ‚Äì user authentication info
- **contexts** ‚Äì maps users to clusters with optional namespaces
- **current-context** ‚Äì the active context being used

### **Commands**
- ‚úÖ View current context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config current-context
  ```
- üìã List all contexts:
  ```bash
  kubectl config get-contexts
  ```
- üîÅ Switch context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config use-context <context-name>
  ```
- üìç Set default namespace for a context:
  ```bash
  kubectl config set-context demo-context --namespace=dev
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è kind Multi-Node Cluster Example

**multi-node.yaml**
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

**Create cluster:**
```bash
kind create cluster --config=multi-node.yaml --name my-cluster
```

## üê≥ Docker vs Kubernetes Commands

| Docker Command                  | Kubernetes Equivalent       |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `docker ps`                    | `kubectl get pods`         |
| `docker run nginx`             | Use deployment or pod spec |
| Image used: `nginx`            | Same in K8s pod spec       |
