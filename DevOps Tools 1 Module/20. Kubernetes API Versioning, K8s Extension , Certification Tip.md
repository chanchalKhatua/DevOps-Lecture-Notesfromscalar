##  Admission Controllers


### **Purpose:**
Admission controllers are plugins that enforce policies on objects being created or updated in a Kubernetes cluster. These policies are essential to maintain security, resource limits, and operational efficiency controlled by API server. Admission Controller validate modify or reject API request before getting applied to the cluster. **They intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server before an object is created, but after the request is authenticated and authorized.**

### **Types of Admission Controllers:**
1. **Mutating Admission Controller:**
   - Modifies objects or requests to enforce certain policies before they are accepted into the cluster.

   - Example: Automatically adding labels to pods.

2. **Validating Admission Controller:**  Ensures requests meet certain criteria and validates configurations.

   - Example: Rejecting deployments with insecure configurations.

3. Dual purpose: Both mutating and validating
   LimitRanger- Adds default resource requests/limits if missing (mutates) and rejects pods that exceed limits (validates).
  

### **Commonly Used Admission Controllers:**
| Controller         | Purpose                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Namespace Lifecycle | Prevents operations on resources in non-existent namespaces |
| Limit Ranger        | Enforces default resource limits                    |
| Resource Quota      | Enforces quotas on the number of resources used     |

#  Kubernetes Resources and Autoscaling
### Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

### Overview
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) extend Kubernetes by defining new resource types. This allows users to create, manage, and interact with custom resources using Kubernetes' API.

### Example: CRD for Fruits

### CRD Definition
```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: fruits.mygroup.example.com
spec:
  group: mygroup.example.com
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: fruits
    singular: fruit
    kind: Fruit
    shortNames:
      - fr
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                color:
                  type: string
                taste:
                  type: string
```

### Explanation of Fields
- `metadata.name` → Fully qualified name of the CRD (`fruits.mygroup.example.com`).
- `group: mygroup.example.com` → Defines the API group.
- `scope: Namespaced` → The resource exists within a namespace.
- `names:`
  - `plural: fruits` → Used for multiple resources (`kubectl get fruits`).
  - `singular: fruit` → Used for a single resource (`kubectl get fruit apple`).
  - `kind: Fruit` → The Kubernetes kind (`kubectl get Fruit`).
  - `shortNames: ["fr"]` → Short alias (`kubectl get fr`).
- `versions:`
  - `name: v1` → Version of the CRD.
  - `served: true` → Kubernetes accepts requests for this version.
  - `storage: true` → This version is stored in etcd.
- `schema: openAPIV3Schema` → Defines resource structure using OpenAPI v3 schema.
  - `properties:`
    - `color:` → String field for color.
    - `taste:` → String field for taste.

### Custom Resource Example
```yaml
apiVersion: mygroup.example.com/v1
kind: Fruit
metadata:
  name: apple
spec:
  color: red
  taste: sweet
```

### Kubernetes Ingress History
- **Kubernetes v1.1 (2015):** Ingress introduced as `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`.
- **Kubernetes v1.19 (2020):** Ingress graduated to GA as `networking.k8s.io/v1`.
- **Kubernetes v1.10:** Ingress did not exist.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU or memory utilization. It uses the Kubernetes Metrics Server to monitor resource consumption and dynamically adjust pod replicas.
- Configured using `autoscaling/v2` API.
- Works with Deployment, StatefulSet, and ReplicaSet.
- `kubectl get hpa` shows current scaling status.

### Custom Nginx and HAProxy Configurations
- **Nginx:** Often used as an ingress controller or reverse proxy in Kubernetes.
  - Custom configuration using ConfigMaps and Annotations.
  - Load balancing and TLS termination support.
- **HAProxy:** A high-performance load balancer with dynamic configuration support.
  - Used in cloud-native environments for traffic distribution.
  - Can be integrated with Kubernetes for advanced routing.

### Batch Jobs and Non-Jobs
- **Batch Jobs:** Kubernetes Job resources execute tasks that run to completion.
  - Useful for database migrations, backups, and scheduled tasks.
  - Can be managed using CronJobs for periodic execution.
- **Non-Jobs (Long-Running Services):** Workloads that run continuously, such as web applications and microservices.
  - Managed using Deployments, StatefulSets, or DaemonSets.
  - Typically require persistent storage and service discovery.

### **Core Resources:**
1. **Pods:**
   - Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.
   - Represents a group of containers with shared storage, network, and specifications.

2. **Services:**
   - Abstracts and exposes pods as network services.
   - Ensures stable communication between pods and users.

3. **ConfigMaps:**
   - Stores non-sensitive configuration data in a key-value format.

4. **Secrets:**
   - Stores sensitive data like passwords and tokens securely.

5. **Namespaces:**
   - Provides a mechanism to isolate groups of resources within a cluster.

6. **Persistent Volumes (PVs):**
   - Provides storage resources for pods, independent of their lifecycle.

### **Workload Resources (apps/v1, batch/v1):**
1. **Deployment:**
   - Manages replicated applications.
   - Supports rolling updates.

2. **ReplicaSet:**
   - Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any time.

3. **StatefulSet:**
   - Manages stateful applications with stable network identities and persistent storage.

4. **DaemonSet:**
   - Ensures a copy of a pod runs on all or selected nodes in the cluster.

5. **Job:**
   - Manages batch jobs.
   - Ensures specified tasks are completed successfully.

6. **CronJob:**
   - Schedules jobs to run at specific times or intervals.

### **Networking Resources (networking.k8s.io):**
1. **Ingress:**
   - Manages external access to services within the cluster.
   - Acts as an HTTP/HTTPS proxy.

2. **Network Policy:**
   - Controls traffic flow between pods.
   - Example: Allowing only specific pods to communicate.

3. **Service:**
   - Exposes a set of pods and ensures stable networking.

### **Storage Resources:**
1. **Storage Class:**
   - Defines different types of storage and policies for dynamic provisioning.

### **RBAC & Authorization:**
Kubernetes provides **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions.

**API Group:** `rbac.authorization.k8s.io`

**Resources:**
1. **Roles:**
   - Assign permissions within a namespace.

2. **Role Bindings:**
   - Binds roles to users or groups within a namespace.

3. **Cluster Roles:**

##  Autoscaling
Kubernetes provides tools to automatically adjust resources based on usage.

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA):**
   - Scales pods horizontally based on CPU or custom metrics.

2. **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA):**
   - Adjusts resource requests and limits for containers based on actual usage.

##  Key Commands (kubectl)


### **Basic Pod Commands:**
1. `kubectl get pods -o wide`
   - Displays detailed pod information in a wide format.

2. `kubectl get pods -o json`
   - Outputs pod details in JSON format.

3. `kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Running`
   - Filters pods based on their running status.

4. `kubectl get pods --watch`
   - Watches for changes in pod status in real-time.

### **Aliases:**
1. `alias kgp='kubectl get pods'`
   - Shortens the command to list pods.

### **Other Commands:**
1. `kubectl exec`
   - Executes commands directly within a container.

## **Examples for Better Understanding:**
1. **Mutating Admission Controller Example:**
   - Automatically adding a label to pods using `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`.

2. **Validating Admission Controller Example:**
   - Ensuring deployments do not use `latest` tag for images.

3. **API Version Usage Example:**
   - Using `apps/v1` for deploying a sample application.
