Below is a comprehensive guide to **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and **Docker Swarm** commands, formatted as a Markdown reference file. I have included common options like `-a` and others for each category.

## 🐋 Docker Engine CLI (Single Host)

Manage individual containers, images, volumes, and networks.

|  | `-q`, `--quiet` | Only display numeric IDs. |
| `docker run` | `-d` | Run container in background (detached). |
|  | `-it` | Interactive mode with a pseudo-TTY. |

|  | `-p 80:80` | Map host port to container port. |
|  | `-v /host:/cont` | Bind mount a volume. |
|  | `--name` | Assign a custom name to the container. |
| `docker logs` | `-f` | Follow log output in real-time. |
|  | `--tail N` | Show only the last N lines. |
| `docker rm` | `-f` | Force the removal of a running container. |
|  | `-v` | Remove anonymous volumes associated with the container. |

### 2. Image Commands

| Command | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker images` | `-a` | Show all images (including intermediate layers). |
| `docker build` | `-t name:tag` | Tag the image during build. |
|  | `--no-cache` | Do not use cache when building the image. |
| `docker rmi` | `-f` | Force removal of an image. |

## 🐙 Docker Compose (Multi-Container)

Define and run multi-container applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

| Command | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker compose up` | `-d` | Start services in the background. |
|  | `--build` | Force rebuild of images before starting. |
| `docker compose down` | `-v` | Stop and remove containers + **named volumes**. |
|  | `--rmi all` | Remove all images used by any service. |
| `docker compose ps` | `-a` | Show all containers in the stack (even stopped). |
| `docker compose logs` | `-f` | Stream logs from all services in the stack. |
| `docker compose exec` | `-it` | Execute a command inside a specific service. |

## 🐝 Docker Swarm (Orchestration)

Manage a cluster of Docker Engines.

### 1. Cluster & Node Management

| Command | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker swarm init` | `--advertise-addr` | Initialize swarm and set the manager IP. |
| `docker node ls` |  | List all nodes in the swarm. |
| `docker node inspect` | `--pretty` | View node details in human-readable format. |
| `docker swarm leave` | `--force` | Force a node to leave (required for managers). |

### 2. Service & Stack Management

| Command | Options | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker service ls` |  | List all active services in the swarm. |
| `docker service ps` |  | List tasks (replicas) of a specific service. |
| `docker service scale` | `svc=N` | Scale a service to N replicas. |
| `docker service update` | `--image` | Update a service's image (rolling update). |
| `docker stack deploy` | `-c file.yml` | Deploy or update a stack from a compose file. |
| `docker stack rm` |  | Remove an entire stack and its services. |

## 🧹 System Maintenance (Prune)

Used to clean up unused resources across all three tools.

* `docker system prune -a`: Remove all unused containers, networks, and images (not just dangling ones).
* `docker volume prune`: Remove all unused local volumes.
* `docker image prune -a`: Remove all unused images.

**Would you like me to create a sample `docker-compose.yml` file so you can practice using these commands?**
