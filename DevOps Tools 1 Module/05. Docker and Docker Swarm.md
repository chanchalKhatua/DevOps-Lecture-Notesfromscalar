# Typed Notes of Docker and Docker Swarm

### 📘 **How Dockerfile Works?**

A Dockerfile is a script with a set of instructions used to automate the creation of Docker images. Here’s a conceptual breakdown:

- In a typical Linux environment, developers often run **shell scripts** or **Python applications** directly on the machine.
- However, Docker introduces **containers**, which serve as isolated environments to run applications.
- With a **Dockerfile**, we can:
  1. Copy an application (e.g., a Python script) into a container.
  2. Run the application inside the container.
  
This means the container acts as a **lightweight virtual machine**.  
To run a container, you need:
1. **Application Code**  
2. **Dockerfile** – Docker will consume the application code and create an image based on the Dockerfile.

---

### 🧩 **Components of a Dockerfile**

#### 1️⃣ **EXPOSE**
- The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker about the ports on which the container will listen at runtime.

**Difference between EXPOSE and `-p` flag:**
| EXPOSE         | -p (publish)               |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Informs Docker about the port | Maps the container port to the host machine |
| Works internally within Docker | Exposes the port externally to users |

#### 2️⃣ **HEALTH CHECK**
- Used to ensure the container is working as expected.  
Example:  
```bash
FROM nginx:alpine
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --retries=3 --start-period=5s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
```
This runs a health check every **30 seconds**, times out in **10 seconds**, and retries up to **3 times**.

🧪 Bonus: Use Healthcheck in Compose
In docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: healthcheck-demo
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  app:
    image: my-app
    depends_on:
      web:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - default
```
✅ This ensures your app starts only after web is healthy.
---

#### 3️⃣ **ARG** (Build-time Variables)
- Defines variables that can be passed during the **build process** using the `docker build` command.

Example:
```dockerfile
ARG build_version
RUN echo "version $build_version"
```

Usage during build:
```bash
docker build --build-arg build_version=1.0 .
```
---

## 🐳 `ARG` vs `ENV` in Docker

### 🔹 `ARG` (Build-Time Variable)
- Used **only during image build**
- Not accessible in containers after build
- Must be passed using `--build-arg`
- Can be used to set `ENV` variables

### 🔹 `ENV` (Run-Time Variable)
- Used during build **and runtime**
- Available inside running containers
- Can be overridden using `-e` during `docker run`

---

### ✅ Example: `ARG` + `ENV`

#### 📄 `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

# Build-time variable
ARG GREETING="Hello"

# Runtime environment variable
ENV GREETING=$GREETING

# Will echo during build
RUN echo $GREETING

# Will echo during runtime
CMD ["sh", "-c", "echo Hi $GREETING"]
```

#### 🚀 Build the image:
```bash
docker build --build-arg GREETING="Hello, Docker!" -t env-example .
```

#### ▶️ Run the container:
```bash
docker run -e GREETING="Vedant!" env-example
# Output: Hi Vedant!
```
> If you don’t pass `-e`, it will use the value baked in from build time.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Feature      | `ARG`                        | `ENV`                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Scope        | Build-time only               | Build-time + Run-time         |
| Access in RUN| ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                        |
| Access in CMD| ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                        |
| Override     | `--build-arg` (build time)    | `-e` (run time)               |
| Example Use  | Software version, credentials | App configs, environment type |

---

---

#### 4️⃣ **USER**
- The `USER` instruction specifies which user will execute subsequent Dockerfile commands.  
This is useful for running commands with **different permissions**.
```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Add a new user
RUN useradd -m myuser

# Switch to that user
USER myuser

# Default command
CMD ["whoami"]
```
---

#### 5️⃣ **Multi-Stage Builds**
- **Multi-stage builds** help create smaller and more efficient Docker images by using multiple `FROM` statements in the same Dockerfile.  
- The **artifacts** generated in one stage can be copied into the final image, reducing image size.
---

### ✅ Final Directory Structure:
```
project/
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── script.py
```

---

### ✅ `script.py`
```python
import requests

def main():
    print("Hello from a Python script!")
    response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
    print("GitHub API Status Code:", response.status_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### ✅ `requirements.txt`
```txt
requests
```

---

### ✅ `Dockerfile` (Multi-stage Build)
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage using slim image
FROM python:3.10-slim AS build-stage

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy application code
COPY script.py .

# Stage 2: Final image using lightweight Alpine
FROM python:3.10-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy installed packages from build stage
COPY --from=build-stage /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages

# Copy application script
COPY --from=build-stage /app/script.py .

# Set entrypoint
CMD ["python", "script.py"]
```

---

### ✅ To Build & Run:
```bash
docker build -t python-multistage-app .
docker run --rm python-multistage-app
```

---

This approach ensures:

- Small final image (Alpine).
- Dependencies installed only in build stage.
- Simple and clean execution.

---

#### 6️⃣ **INSPECT**
- The `docker inspect` command provides detailed information about a container or image, including its configuration, state, and network settings.

Common usage examples:
```bash
docker inspect container_id
docker inspect --format='{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' container_id
```
The second command returns the **IP address** of the container.

---

# 🔧 **Building Efficient Images**

### ✅ **Benefits**
- **Faster Deployment**
- **Lower Storage Costs**
- **Reduced Resource Consumption**
- **Improved Security**
- **Easier Maintenance**
- **Better Performance**

---

## 🛠️ How to Achieve It

### 🔁 **1. Use Multi-Stage Builds**
- Keep the final image clean by separating build tools and dependencies.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

FROM python:3.10-alpine
COPY --from=build /app /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD ["python", "script.py"]
```

---

### 🧱 **2. Use Minimal Base Images**
- Prefer `alpine`, `slim`, or distroless images when possible.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
FROM python:3.10-slim
```

---

### 📦 **3. Clean Up After Installation**

**Bad:**
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

**Better:**
```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

---

### 🧹 **4. Minimize Layers**
- Combine commands using `&&` to reduce layers.

```dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

---

### 🧼 **5. Use `.dockerignore` File**
Prevent copying unnecessary files like:
```dockerignore
.git
__pycache__
*.log
tmp/
.DS_Store
```

---

### 📂 **6. Use `COPY` Properly**
- Use `COPY` instead of `ADD` unless you need automatic unpacking of tar files.
- Minimize context:

```dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
```

---

### 🏗️ **7. Use `ARG` for Build-Time Variables**

```dockerfile
ARG APP_VERSION=1.0
ENV VERSION=$APP_VERSION
```

Build with:
```bash
docker build --build-arg APP_VERSION=2.0 .
```

---

### ⚡ **8. Avoid Running as Root in Final Image**

```dockerfile
RUN adduser -D appuser
USER appuser
```

---

### 📌 Bonus Tips:
- **Tag images** properly: `myapp:1.0`, `myapp:latest`
- **Leverage caching**: Copy `requirements.txt` before the full code
- Use **multi-stage to compile binaries** (Go, Node.js, etc.) and copy only the final build

# 📏 **Flattening a Docker Image**


### 🛠️ **What is Flattening a Docker Image?**

Flattening a Docker image involves combining all the **layers** of an image into a **single layer**. This can help simplify images and optimize them for deployment.

### 📋 **Why Flatten an Image?**
1. **Reduce Complexity**  
   - Fewer layers mean a simpler image structure.
2. **Reduce Size**  
   - Flattening can help remove unnecessary layers and reduce image size.
3. **Increase Security**  
   - Reduces the risk of leftover sensitive files in layers.
4. **Optimize for Deployment**  
   - Faster deployment due to reduced size and complexity.

---

### 📘 **Steps to Flatten an Image**

1. **Run the Image and Create a Container**  
   ```bash
   docker run --name my_container my_image
   ```

2. **Export the Container Filesystem**  
   ```bash
   docker export my_container -o flat_image.tar
   ```

3. **Import the Flattened Image as a New Image**  
   ```bash
   docker import flat_image.tar my_flat_image
   ```
*******************************************

### 🧰 Step-by-Step Process

#### **1. Run a Container from Your Image**
```bash
docker run --name flat-demo-container your-image-name
```

#### **2. (Optional) Make Any Final Changes**
You can `docker exec -it flat-demo-container sh` and make final tweaks (like deleting temp files, logs, etc.).

---

#### **3. Export the Container's Filesystem**
```bash
docker export flat-demo-container > flattened.tar
```

---

#### **4. Import it Back as a New Flattened Image**
```bash
cat flattened.tar | docker import - flattened-image:latest
```

> ✅ `docker import` creates a single-layer image.

---

### 📝 Notes:
- You’ll **lose Dockerfile history, environment variables, labels, etc.** — it’s a clean slate.
- If you want to add `CMD` or `ENV`, do it during or after `docker import`:
```bash
cat flattened.tar | docker import -c 'CMD ["python", "script.py"]' - flattened-image:v1
```
