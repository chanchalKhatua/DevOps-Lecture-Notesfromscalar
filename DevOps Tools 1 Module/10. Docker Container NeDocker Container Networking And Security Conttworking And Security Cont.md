# Typed Notes of Docker Container Networking and Security

# 🌐 **Docker Networking**


### 🔎 **Overview of Docker Networking**

- Containers are isolated environments. By default, they don’t know about each other unless Docker Swarm is used.
- Containers act like **small virtual machines** and sometimes need to communicate with each other for a single application to function properly.
- To achieve this, Docker provides **networking capabilities** that connect containers, allowing them to communicate securely and efficiently.
- Docker networks are built using **drivers**. Each type of network corresponds to a built-in Docker driver.

### 🧩 **Types of Docker Networks**

| **Network Type** | **Description**                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bridge           | Default network for containers on a single host.            |
| Host             | Shares the host’s network namespace with the container.     |
| None             | Disables all networking for a container.                   |
| Overlay          | Connects containers across multiple Docker hosts.           |
| Macvlan          | Assigns a unique MAC address to containers, making them appear as physical devices on the network. |

---

## 🛠️ **Basic Docker Networking Commands**

1. **List all networks:**
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```
2. **Inspect a network’s configuration:**
   ```bash
   docker network inspect <network_name>
   ```

## 🌉 **Bridge Network (Default Network)**

### 📝 **What is a Bridge Network?**
- The **default network** assigned to containers when no other network is specified.
- Each container has its own **IP address** within the bridge network.
- You can create **custom bridge networks** to isolate groups of containers.

### 🧪 **Scenario: Custom Bridge Network**
- Containers **C1** and **C2** use the default bridge network.
- Containers **C3** and **C4** need to be isolated but must communicate with each other.  
  Solution: Create a **custom bridge network** and assign **C3** and **C4** to it.

### 🔗 **How Bridge Network Works?**
- A **web server** container and a **database** container are isolated by default.
- To allow communication, both containers need to be assigned to a **bridge network**.

**Command to create a custom bridge network:**
```bash
docker network create my_bridge_network
```

---

## 🌐 **Host Network**

### 📝 **What is a Host Network?**
- Removes **network isolation** between the container and the Docker host.
- The container shares the host’s network namespace, meaning:
  - **No port mapping is required.**
  - The container has **direct access** to the host's network interfaces.

**Use case:**  
- When you need **low-latency communication** between the host and the container.  
- Ideal for **performance monitoring** or **network traffic analysis**.

**Command to run a container with host networking:**
```bash
docker run -d --name perf_app --network host my_perf_image
```

---

## 🚫 **None Network**

### 📝 **What is a None Network?**
- Disables **all networking** for a container.
- The container is completely **isolated** from the network.

**Command to create a container with no networking:**
```bash
docker run -d --name isolated_task --network none image_name
```

---

## 🕸️ **Overlay Network**

### 📝 **What is an Overlay Network?**
- **Overlay networks** connect containers running on **different Docker hosts**.
- Used in **Docker Swarm clusters** to enable container communication across nodes.
- Essential for **scaling applications** across multiple hosts.

📷 *Diagram: Overlay Network*  
![Overlay Network](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/102/197/original/overlay_network.png?1736179120)

**Command to create an overlay network:**
```bash
docker network create -d overlay name_of_network
```

**Example of creating a service on an overlay network:**
```bash
docker service create --name web_service --network name_of_overlay_network --replicas 3 image_name
```

---

## 📡 **Macvlan Network**

### 📝 **What is a Macvlan Network?**
- Allows Docker containers to **appear as physical devices** on the network.
- Each container is assigned a unique **MAC address** and behaves like a separate machine.

**Use case:**  
- Ideal for **data centers** where containers need to run services like **VPN servers** or **firewalls** while appearing as distinct network devices.

**Command to create a Macvlan network:**
```bash
docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 -o parent=eth0 name_of_network
```

# ❓ **Interview Questions on Docker**

### 💡 **Q1: How will you expose your container externally?**

There are several ways to expose a container externally:

1. **Port Binding:**  
   - Map a port on the **Docker host** to a port on the **container** using the `-p` flag.  
   Example:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
   ```

2. **Using Docker Compose:**  
   - Define port mappings in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Using Docker Swarm Services:**  
   - Use the `--publish` flag to expose services to external networks.

4. **Using Proxy Servers (e.g., Nginx):**  
   - Use Nginx to route requests to specific services based on the request path.  
   Example Nginx configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com;

       location /service1 {
           proxy_pass http://service1:80;
       }

       location /service2 {
           proxy_pass http://service2:80;
       }
   }
   ```

### 💡 **Q2: Common Issues in Docker and Their Troubleshooting Steps**

| **Issue**             | **Description**                                      | **Troubleshooting Steps**                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Connectivity Issues   | Containers can't communicate                         | Check network configurations and logs.                |
| DNS Resolution Failure | Containers unable to resolve DNS names               | Inspect `/etc/resolv.conf` inside the container.       |
| Port Binding Conflicts | Port already in use                                  | Use `netstat -tulpn` to find conflicting processes.    |

**Debugging Tools:**
- **Docker Logs:**  
   ```bash
   docker logs container_name
   ```
- **Docker Inspect:**  
   ```bash
   docker inspect container_name
   ```
- **Network Traffic Monitoring:**  
   - Use **tcpdump** or **Wireshark** to monitor network traffic.

# 🔐 **Security Aspects of Docker**


# Docker Content Trust (DCT) and Image Signing

## Importance of Image Signing
- Ensures **image integrity** by preventing tampering.
- Verifies **authenticity** of images, ensuring they come from trusted sources.
- Helps enforce **compliance and security policies** in a containerized environment.
- **DCT Notary** guarantees the provenance of content by signing and verifying images.

## Enabling Docker Content Trust (DCT)
To enable DCT globally, set the following environment variable:
```sh
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

## Verifying Signed Images
### Pulling a Signed Image
```sh
docker pull library/alpine:latest
```

### Checking Signatures and Signers
```sh
docker trust inspect image:tag
```
Example:
```sh
docker trust inspect nigelpoulton/dockerbook:unsigned
```
If the image is unsigned, DCT will prevent it from being pulled.

## Signing Your Own Image
### Prerequisites
- **Login to Docker Hub**
```sh
docker login
```
- **Create a Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY hello.txt /app/hello.txt
CMD ["cat", "/app/hello.txt"]
```

### Building and Signing an Image
```sh
echo "Hello, Docker Content Trust!" > hello.txt
docker build -t vedant120/app:latest .
```
When DCT is enabled, the image will be **automatically signed** upon pushing to Docker Hub.
```sh
docker push vedant120/app:latest
```

### Inspecting the Signed Image
```sh
docker trust inspect vedant120/app:latest
```

## Handling Unsigned Images
### Example of an Unsigned Image
Attempting to pull an unsigned image when DCT is enabled:
```sh
docker pull nigelpoulton/dockerbook:unsigned
```
This will fail because the image is **not signed**.

## Disabling Docker Content Trust
To temporarily disable DCT and allow pulling unsigned images:
```sh
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0
```

## Removing a Signature from an Image
To revoke trust and remove a signature from an image:
```sh
docker trust revoke image
```

By using Docker Content Trust (DCT), you can ensure a secure and verified workflow when working with container images.

Here’s a well-structured and organized version of your notes on **Docker Namespaces and Capabilities**:  

---

# **Docker Namespaces and Capabilities**

## **1. Viewing Namespaces in a Running Container**
To list namespaces inside a running Docker container, use:  
```sh
docker exec -it container_nginx lsns
```

## **2. Types of Namespaces**
Docker uses Linux namespaces to provide isolation. The different types are:

- **`time`** → Manages system time. Each namespace can have its own clock.  
- **`user`** → Isolates user and group IDs, allowing different UIDs and GIDs inside the container.  
- **`mnt`** → Isolates mount points, providing a separate filesystem hierarchy.  
- **`uts`** → Isolates hostname and domain name, allowing different hostnames for containers.  
- **`ipc`** → Isolates inter-process communication (IPC) resources like semaphores, message queues, and shared memory.  
- **`pid`** → Isolates process IDs, providing a separate PID space inside the container.  
- **`cgroup`** → Isolates control groups (`cgroups`), used to manage resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.).  
- **`net`** → Isolates networking, allowing the container to have its own network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules.  

---

## **3. Common Linux Capabilities in Docker**
Docker does not run containers with full root privileges. Instead, it grants a subset of Linux capabilities. Below are some common ones:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **CAP_NET_ADMIN** | Modify network settings (e.g., bring interfaces up/down, change IPs). |
| **CAP_SYS_ADMIN** | Perform system-level administrative tasks (e.g., mount filesystems, set system time). |
| **CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE** | Bypass file permission checks (use with caution!). |
| **CAP_SYS_TIME** | Change the system clock or time zone. |
| **CAP_CHOWN** | Change file ownership (users and groups). |
| **CAP_KILL** | Send signals to other processes, even those of other users. |
| **CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE** | Bind to ports below 1024 (normally restricted to privileged processes). |
| **CAP_SYS_PTRACE** | Trace other processes (useful for debugging but a security risk). |

---

## **4. Running a Container with Custom Capabilities**
### **Run a Container with Added Capabilities**
You can add specific capabilities using `--cap-add`:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN ubuntu bash
```
To add multiple capabilities:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_TIME ubuntu bash
```

### **Run a Container Without Certain Capabilities**
To drop a capability, use `--cap-drop`:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-drop=SYS_TIME ubuntu bash
```

---

## **5. Modifying Capabilities in a Running Container**
If a container is already running, you can update its capabilities using:
```sh
docker update --cap-add=NET_ADMIN container_name
```

---

## **6. Checking Capabilities Inside a Container**
To check capabilities inside a running container:  
1. Start an Ubuntu container:
   ```sh
   docker run -dit --name container_ubuntu ubuntu
   ```
2. Install capability tools:
   ```sh
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y libcap2-bin
   ```
3. Print the current capabilities:
   ```sh
   capsh --print
   ```

---

## **7. Understanding Capability Sets**
Linux defines different sets of capabilities within a container:  

- **Bounding Set** → The upper limit of capabilities a container can have.  
- **Permitted Set** → Capabilities the process is currently allowed to use.  
- **Inheritable Set** → Capabilities that can be passed to child processes.

### 🔐 What is Seccomp?
**Seccomp** (short for **Secure Computing Mode**) is a Linux kernel feature that allows you to restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing the security of the system by reducing the attack surface.
Seccomp (Secure Computing) is a **Linux kernel** feature that:
- Restricts the **system calls** a process can make.
- Reduces the **attack surface** of the application.
- Helps mitigate **zero-day vulnerabilities** by blocking unnecessary or dangerous syscalls.

---

### 📄 Sample Seccomp Profile Explanation

Here's the profile you shared:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": ["execve", "exit_group"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "names": ["kill", "ptrace"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 🔍 What it does:
- `defaultAction: SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`: All syscalls are **allowed by default**.
- `execve` and `exit_group`: Explicitly **allowed** (redundant here, since default is allow).
- `kill` and `ptrace`: These are **blocked** and will return an error if used by the process.

This is useful when you want to **explicitly block some dangerous syscalls**, but allow everything else.

---

### 🐳 How to Run a Docker Container with This Seccomp Profile

Use this command:

```bash
docker run -d --security-opt seccomp=/path/to/seccomp/profile.json nginx
```

#### ✅ What this does:
- Launches the container in **detached mode** (`-d`).
- Applies your **custom seccomp profile**.
- Runs the official **NGINX** image.

> ⚠️ Make sure `/path/to/seccomp/profile.json` is accessible and valid on the Docker host.

---

### 📌 Tips
- Default Docker uses a restrictive seccomp profile already: `/usr/share/docker/seccomp.json`
- You can **create more restrictive profiles** by defaulting to `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and only allowing a **minimal set of syscalls**.
- Combine with **AppArmor, SELinux, or capabilities** for enhanced container security.

### 🔐 **2. Mutual TLS (MTLS)**
- Use **TLS certificates** to secure communication between Docker clients and servers.

**Configuration in `daemon.json`:**
```json
{
    "tls": true,
    "tlscacert": "/path/to/ca.pem",
    "tlscert": "/path/to/server-cert.pem",
    "tlskey": "/path/to/server-key.pem",
    "tlsverify": true
}
```

---

### 🛠️ **Generating a Certificate**

1. **Generate CA key and certificate.**  
2. **Generate server key and certificate.**  
3. **Sign the server certificate.**  
4. **Generate client certificate.**  
5. **Sign the client certificate.**
