# Typed Notes of Docker Container Networking and Security

# 🌐 **Docker Networking**


### 🔎 **Overview of Docker Networking**

- Containers are isolated environments. By default, they don’t know about each other unless Docker Swarm is used.
- Containers act like **small virtual machines** and sometimes need to communicate with each other for a single application to function properly.
- To achieve this, Docker provides **networking capabilities** that connect containers, allowing them to communicate securely and efficiently.
- Docker networks are built using **drivers**. Each type of network corresponds to a built-in Docker driver.

---

### 🧩 **Types of Docker Networks**

| **Network Type** | **Description**                                            |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bridge           | Default network for containers on a single host.            |
| Host             | Shares the host’s network namespace with the container.     |
| None             | Disables all networking for a container.                   |
| Overlay          | Connects containers across multiple Docker hosts.           |
| Macvlan          | Assigns a unique MAC address to containers, making them appear as physical devices on the network. |

---

## 🛠️ **Basic Docker Networking Commands**

1. **List all networks:**
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```
2. **Inspect a network’s configuration:**
   ```bash
   docker network inspect <network_name>
   ```

---

## 🌉 **Bridge Network (Default Network)**

### 📝 **What is a Bridge Network?**
- The **default network** assigned to containers when no other network is specified.
- Each container has its own **IP address** within the bridge network.
- You can create **custom bridge networks** to isolate groups of containers.

### 🧪 **Scenario: Custom Bridge Network**
- Containers **C1** and **C2** use the default bridge network.
- Containers **C3** and **C4** need to be isolated but must communicate with each other.  
  Solution: Create a **custom bridge network** and assign **C3** and **C4** to it.

### 🔗 **How Bridge Network Works?**
- A **web server** container and a **database** container are isolated by default.
- To allow communication, both containers need to be assigned to a **bridge network**.

![Bridge Network Interaction](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/102/191/original/workingofbridgenetwork.png?1736178197)

**Command to create a custom bridge network:**
```bash
docker network create my_bridge_network
```

---

## 🌐 **Host Network**

### 📝 **What is a Host Network?**
- Removes **network isolation** between the container and the Docker host.
- The container shares the host’s network namespace, meaning:
  - **No port mapping is required.**
  - The container has **direct access** to the host's network interfaces.

**Use case:**  
- When you need **low-latency communication** between the host and the container.  
- Ideal for **performance monitoring** or **network traffic analysis**.

**Command to run a container with host networking:**
```bash
docker run -d --name perf_app --network host my_perf_image
```

---

## 🚫 **None Network**

### 📝 **What is a None Network?**
- Disables **all networking** for a container.
- The container is completely **isolated** from the network.

**Command to create a container with no networking:**
```bash
docker run -d --name isolated_task --network none image_name
```

---

## 🕸️ **Overlay Network**

### 📝 **What is an Overlay Network?**
- **Overlay networks** connect containers running on **different Docker hosts**.
- Used in **Docker Swarm clusters** to enable container communication across nodes.
- Essential for **scaling applications** across multiple hosts.

📷 *Diagram: Overlay Network*  
![Overlay Network](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/102/197/original/overlay_network.png?1736179120)

**Command to create an overlay network:**
```bash
docker network create -d overlay name_of_network
```

**Example of creating a service on an overlay network:**
```bash
docker service create --name web_service --network name_of_overlay_network --replicas 3 image_name
```

---

## 📡 **Macvlan Network**

### 📝 **What is a Macvlan Network?**
- Allows Docker containers to **appear as physical devices** on the network.
- Each container is assigned a unique **MAC address** and behaves like a separate machine.

**Use case:**  
- Ideal for **data centers** where containers need to run services like **VPN servers** or **firewalls** while appearing as distinct network devices.

**Command to create a Macvlan network:**
```bash
docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 -o parent=eth0 name_of_network
```

---

# ❓ **Interview Questions on Docker**

### 💡 **Q1: How will you expose your container externally?**

There are several ways to expose a container externally:

1. **Port Binding:**  
   - Map a port on the **Docker host** to a port on the **container** using the `-p` flag.  
   Example:  
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
   ```

2. **Using Docker Compose:**  
   - Define port mappings in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Using Docker Swarm Services:**  
   - Use the `--publish` flag to expose services to external networks.

4. **Using Proxy Servers (e.g., Nginx):**  
   - Use Nginx to route requests to specific services based on the request path.  
   Example Nginx configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com;

       location /service1 {
           proxy_pass http://service1:80;
       }

       location /service2 {
           proxy_pass http://service2:80;
       }
   }
   ```

### 💡 **Q2: Common Issues in Docker and Their Troubleshooting Steps**

| **Issue**             | **Description**                                      | **Troubleshooting Steps**                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Connectivity Issues   | Containers can't communicate                         | Check network configurations and logs.                |
| DNS Resolution Failure | Containers unable to resolve DNS names               | Inspect `/etc/resolv.conf` inside the container.       |
| Port Binding Conflicts | Port already in use                                  | Use `netstat -tulpn` to find conflicting processes.    |

**Debugging Tools:**
- **Docker Logs:**  
   ```bash
   docker logs container_name
   ```
- **Docker Inspect:**  
   ```bash
   docker inspect container_name
   ```
- **Network Traffic Monitoring:**  
   - Use **tcpdump** or **Wireshark** to monitor network traffic.

# 🔐 **Security Aspects of Docker**


# Docker Content Trust (DCT) and Image Signing

## Importance of Image Signing
- Ensures **image integrity** by preventing tampering.
- Verifies **authenticity** of images, ensuring they come from trusted sources.
- Helps enforce **compliance and security policies** in a containerized environment.
- **DCT Notary** guarantees the provenance of content by signing and verifying images.

## Enabling Docker Content Trust (DCT)
To enable DCT globally, set the following environment variable:
```sh
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

## Verifying Signed Images
### Pulling a Signed Image
```sh
docker pull library/alpine:latest
```

### Checking Signatures and Signers
```sh
docker trust inspect image:tag
```
Example:
```sh
docker trust inspect nigelpoulton/dockerbook:unsigned
```
If the image is unsigned, DCT will prevent it from being pulled.

## Signing Your Own Image
### Prerequisites
- **Login to Docker Hub**
```sh
docker login
```
- **Create a Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY hello.txt /app/hello.txt
CMD ["cat", "/app/hello.txt"]
```

### Building and Signing an Image
```sh
echo "Hello, Docker Content Trust!" > hello.txt
docker build -t vedant120/app:latest .
```
When DCT is enabled, the image will be **automatically signed** upon pushing to Docker Hub.
```sh
docker push vedant120/app:latest
```

### Inspecting the Signed Image
```sh
docker trust inspect vedant120/app:latest
```

## Handling Unsigned Images
### Example of an Unsigned Image
Attempting to pull an unsigned image when DCT is enabled:
```sh
docker pull nigelpoulton/dockerbook:unsigned
```
This will fail because the image is **not signed**.

## Disabling Docker Content Trust
To temporarily disable DCT and allow pulling unsigned images:
```sh
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=0
```

## Removing a Signature from an Image
To revoke trust and remove a signature from an image:
```sh
docker trust revoke image
```

By using Docker Content Trust (DCT), you can ensure a secure and verified workflow when working with container images.

Here’s a well-structured and organized version of your notes on **Docker Namespaces and Capabilities**:  

---

# **Docker Namespaces and Capabilities**

## **1. Viewing Namespaces in a Running Container**
To list namespaces inside a running Docker container, use:  
```sh
docker exec -it container_nginx lsns
```

## **2. Types of Namespaces**
Docker uses Linux namespaces to provide isolation. The different types are:

- **`time`** → Manages system time. Each namespace can have its own clock.  
- **`user`** → Isolates user and group IDs, allowing different UIDs and GIDs inside the container.  
- **`mnt`** → Isolates mount points, providing a separate filesystem hierarchy.  
- **`uts`** → Isolates hostname and domain name, allowing different hostnames for containers.  
- **`ipc`** → Isolates inter-process communication (IPC) resources like semaphores, message queues, and shared memory.  
- **`pid`** → Isolates process IDs, providing a separate PID space inside the container.  
- **`cgroup`** → Isolates control groups (`cgroups`), used to manage resource limits (CPU, memory, etc.).  
- **`net`** → Isolates networking, allowing the container to have its own network interfaces, routing tables, and firewall rules.  

---

## **3. Common Linux Capabilities in Docker**
Docker does not run containers with full root privileges. Instead, it grants a subset of Linux capabilities. Below are some common ones:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **CAP_NET_ADMIN** | Modify network settings (e.g., bring interfaces up/down, change IPs). |
| **CAP_SYS_ADMIN** | Perform system-level administrative tasks (e.g., mount filesystems, set system time). |
| **CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE** | Bypass file permission checks (use with caution!). |
| **CAP_SYS_TIME** | Change the system clock or time zone. |
| **CAP_CHOWN** | Change file ownership (users and groups). |
| **CAP_KILL** | Send signals to other processes, even those of other users. |
| **CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE** | Bind to ports below 1024 (normally restricted to privileged processes). |
| **CAP_SYS_PTRACE** | Trace other processes (useful for debugging but a security risk). |

---

## **4. Running a Container with Custom Capabilities**
### **Run a Container with Added Capabilities**
You can add specific capabilities using `--cap-add`:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN ubuntu bash
```
To add multiple capabilities:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --cap-add=SYS_TIME ubuntu bash
```

### **Run a Container Without Certain Capabilities**
To drop a capability, use `--cap-drop`:
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-drop=SYS_TIME ubuntu bash
```

---

## **5. Modifying Capabilities in a Running Container**
If a container is already running, you can update its capabilities using:
```sh
docker update --cap-add=NET_ADMIN container_name
```

---

## **6. Checking Capabilities Inside a Container**
To check capabilities inside a running container:  
1. Start an Ubuntu container:
   ```sh
   docker run -dit --name container_ubuntu ubuntu
   ```
2. Install capability tools:
   ```sh
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y libcap2-bin
   ```
3. Print the current capabilities:
   ```sh
   capsh --print
   ```

---

## **7. Understanding Capability Sets**
Linux defines different sets of capabilities within a container:  

- **Bounding Set** → The upper limit of capabilities a container can have.  
- **Permitted Set** → Capabilities the process is currently allowed to use.  
- **Inheritable Set** → Capabilities that can be passed to child processes.

# 🔐 What is Seccomp?
**Seccomp** (short for **Secure Computing Mode**) is a Linux kernel feature that allows you to restrict the system calls a process can make, enhancing the security of the system by reducing the attack surface.
Seccomp (Secure Computing) is a **Linux kernel** feature that:
- Restricts the **system calls** a process can make.
- Reduces the **attack surface** of the application.
- Helps mitigate **zero-day vulnerabilities** by blocking unnecessary or dangerous syscalls.

---

### 📄 Sample Seccomp Profile Explanation

Here's the profile you shared:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": ["execve", "exit_group"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"
    },
    {
      "names": ["kill", "ptrace"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 🔍 What it does:
- `defaultAction: SCMP_ACT_ALLOW`: All syscalls are **allowed by default**.
- `execve` and `exit_group`: Explicitly **allowed** (redundant here, since default is allow).
- `kill` and `ptrace`: These are **blocked** and will return an error if used by the process.

This is useful when you want to **explicitly block some dangerous syscalls**, but allow everything else.

---

### 🐳 How to Run a Docker Container with This Seccomp Profile

Use this command:

```bash
docker run -d --security-opt seccomp=/path/to/seccomp/profile.json nginx
```

#### ✅ What this does:
- Launches the container in **detached mode** (`-d`).
- Applies your **custom seccomp profile**.
- Runs the official **NGINX** image.

> ⚠️ Make sure `/path/to/seccomp/profile.json` is accessible and valid on the Docker host.

---

### 📌 Tips
- Default Docker uses a restrictive seccomp profile already: `/usr/share/docker/seccomp.json`
- You can **create more restrictive profiles** by defaulting to `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` and only allowing a **minimal set of syscalls**.
- Combine with **AppArmor, SELinux, or capabilities** for enhanced container security.

---
Sure! Here's a **well-structured explanation** that includes a **definition** of AppArmor, how to **create and apply a profile for Docker**, the **relevant SELinux comparison**, and **commands for hardening containers**.

---

# 🔐 What is AppArmor?

**AppArmor** (Application Armor) is a **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** security framework for Linux. It restricts what applications can do, using **profiles** that define allowed files, capabilities, and permissions for each process.

> AppArmor enforces **"least privilege"**, allowing applications only the access they explicitly need.

---

## 📄 AppArmor Profile for Docker Containers

Here's an example of a custom AppArmor profile (`/etc/apparmor.d/my_docker_container`) that restricts a Docker container's actions:

### 🔧 Sample AppArmor Profile

```apparmor
profile my_docker_container flags=(attach_disconnected) {

  # Allow the container to read the system hostname
  /etc/hostname r,

  # Allow the container to execute bash with inherited permissions
  /bin/bash ixr,

  # Deny write access to all files (strong isolation)
  deny /** w,

  # Audit all denied write attempts (helpful for debugging/logging)
  audit deny /** w,
}
```

### Explanation of Rules:
| Rule | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `/etc/hostname r,` | Allow read-only access to `/etc/hostname`. |
| `/bin/bash ixr,` | Allow execution of `/bin/bash`, inheriting execution profile. |
| `deny /** w,` | Deny write access anywhere in the file system. |
| `audit deny /** w,` | Log all denied write attempts. |

---

## ⚙️ How to Load and Apply AppArmor Profile

1. **Save** the profile as `/etc/apparmor.d/my_docker_container`
2. **Load the profile** into the kernel:

```bash
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/my_docker_container
```

- `-r`: Replace the profile if it already exists.

3. **Run Docker container using the profile**:

```bash
docker run --security-opt apparmor=my_docker_container my_image
```

- Replace `my_image` with your actual Docker image name.

---

## 🐧 SELinux vs AppArmor

**SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) is another Mandatory Access Control system, used mainly in Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS, Fedora, RHEL). It uses **labels** and **policies** to enforce access controls.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3c03559-4136-41d9-acae-83861f37987a)

### 🔍 SELinux Modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Enforcing | Actively blocks and logs violations |
| Permissive | Only logs violations (for testing) |
| Disabled | SELinux is turned off |

### 💡 Check SELinux Mode:

```bash
getenforce
```

### 🔄 Change SELinux Mode:

```bash
setenforce 1    # Enforcing mode
setenforce 0    # Permissive mode
```

### 🔐 Docker + SELinux Example:

```bash
docker run --security-opt label:type:container_t my_image
```

- `container_t`: SELinux label used by default for containers.

---

## 🔒 Additional Docker Hardening (Applicable to Both)

### ➤ Read-only filesystem:

```bash
docker run -d --read-only nginx
```

- Prevents writes to the container’s root filesystem.

### ➤ Drop all extra capabilities:

```bash
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE my_image
```

- Removes all kernel capabilities, then adds only what’s needed.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | AppArmor | SELinux |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Control Type | Path-based | Label-based |
| Easy to Use | ✅ Yes | ❌ More complex |
| Docker Support | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Logging | ✅ Via audit | ✅ Via audit |
| Profiles | Defined in `/etc/apparmor.d/` | Managed with `semanage`, `setsebool` |

---
---
# **Read only Filesystem**
```bash
docker run -d --read-only nginx
```


---

## 🔐 **Mutual TLS (mTLS) with Docker & NGINX – Step-by-Step with Explanations**

### 🧾 **Why mTLS?**
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** ensures both **server and client** authenticate each other using certificates.
- It’s an extension of TLS where both sides present certificates, not just the server.
- Great for **zero-trust networks**, **microservices**, **compliance** (HIPAA, PCI-DSS), and **enhanced security**.

---

### 📁 **1. Create Directory Structure**
```bash
mkdir -p mTLS-demo/{certs,server}
cd mTLS-demo
```
🔹 Creates folders to separate certificates and server config neatly.

---

### 🔑 **2. Generate CA Private Key**
```bash
openssl genrsa -out certs/ca.key 2048
```
🔹 This key acts as the **private key of your Certificate Authority (CA)** – the entity that signs other certs.

---

### 🏢 **3. Create CA Certificate**
```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key certs/ca.key -sha256 -days 365 \
-out certs/ca.crt -subj "/CN=MyCA"
```
🔹 This self-signed certificate represents your **CA root cert**.
🔹 It's used to **sign server and client certificates** to establish trust.

---

### ⚙️ **4. Create OpenSSL Config File**
`certs/openssl.cnf`
```ini
[ req ]
default_bits = 2048
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req
prompt = no

[ req_distinguished_name ]
CN = localhost

[ v3_req ]
keyUsage = keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = localhost
```
🔹 This config is used when generating the **server certificate**.
🔹 It includes **extensions** like key usage, and **SAN (Subject Alternative Name)** which is now required by many browsers.

---

### 🌐 **5. Generate Server Key & CSR**
```bash
openssl genrsa -out certs/server.key 2048
openssl req -new -key certs/server.key -out certs/server.csr -config certs/openssl.cnf
```
🔹 First command creates a private key.
🔹 Second command creates a **CSR (Certificate Signing Request)** using the key and config.

---

### 🔏 **6. Sign Server Certificate with CA**
```bash
openssl x509 -req -in certs/server.csr -CA certs/ca.crt -CAkey certs/ca.key \
-CAcreateserial -out certs/server.crt -days 365 -extensions v3_req \
-extfile certs/openssl.cnf
```
🔹 Signs the server’s CSR with the **CA**, producing a **trusted server certificate**.

---

### 🧍 **7. Generate Client Certificate**
```bash
openssl genrsa -out certs/client.key 2048
openssl req -new -key certs/client.key -out certs/client.csr -subj "/CN=client"
openssl x509 -req -in certs/client.csr -CA certs/ca.crt -CAkey certs/ca.key \
-CAcreateserial -out certs/client.crt -days 365
```
🔹 Similar to the server:
- Create key  
- Generate CSR  
- Sign with CA  
🔹 Client certs are required to **verify client identity during TLS handshake**.

---

### 📝 **8. NGINX Configuration File**
`server/nginx.conf`
```nginx
events { }

http {
    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/server.key;
        ssl_client_certificate /etc/nginx/ca.crt;
        ssl_verify_client on;

        location / {
            return 200 'mTLS verification successful!';
        }
    }
}
```
🔹 Enables SSL with:
- Server certs
- CA cert to **verify client**
- `ssl_verify_client on` forces client authentication.

---

### 📦 **9. Dockerfile to Containerize NGINX**
`server/Dockerfile`
```Dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest
COPY server.crt /etc/nginx/server.crt
COPY server.key /etc/nginx/server.key
COPY ca.crt /etc/nginx/ca.crt
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
🔹 Copies the certs and config into the **NGINX container image**.

---

### 📁 **10. Copy Certs to Server Folder**
```bash
cp certs/server.crt certs/server.key certs/ca.crt server/
```
🔹 Ensure all required certs are available in the build context of the Dockerfile.

---

### 🛠️ **11. Build Docker Image**
```bash
docker build -t mtls-server ./server
```
🔹 Builds the NGINX image with mTLS config.

---

### 🌐 **12. Create Docker Network**
```bash
docker network create mtls-network
```
🔹 Optional but useful to allow multiple containers to communicate securely.

---

### 🚀 **13. Run Docker Container**
```bash
docker run -d --name mtls-server --network mtls-network -p 443:443 mtls-server
```
🔹 Starts the secure NGINX container with mTLS enabled on port 443.

---

### ✅ **14. Test with cURL**
```bash
curl --cert certs/client.crt --key certs/client.key --cacert certs/ca.crt https://localhost
```
🔹 Sends a client certificate and key for mutual TLS authentication.
🔹 If everything is configured right, you should see:
```
mTLS verification successful!
```
