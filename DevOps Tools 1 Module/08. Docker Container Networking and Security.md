# 🐳 Introduction to Docker Storage

Docker Storage refers to the methods used to **persist data** in Docker containers and manage **container file systems**.

---

### **Why Do We Need Storage in Docker?**  
1. **Data Persistence**: Ensures that data remains available even if the container is deleted.  
2. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Allows storage to be adjusted as needed for various applications.  
3. **Efficient Resource Management**: Prevents duplication of data across containers.  
4. **High Availability and Reliability**: Ensures data remains accessible during container failures.

---
## 📦 Docker Image Layers: Read-Only  
A Docker image is made of several **read-only layers** (OS, libraries, app code). When you run a container from that image, Docker adds a **writable layer on top** of the image stack.

---

### ✍️ Writable Layer (Copy-on-Write):

- When a container writes to a file that exists in a lower (read-only) image layer:
  - Docker **copies that file** from the image layer into the **writable container layer**
  - The container **modifies the copy**, not the original
- This is called **Copy-on-Write (CoW)**

---

### 🧠 Key Points:

- **Writable Layer is ephemeral**: Data is lost if the container is removed.
- **Efficient**: Only modified data is copied, saving storage space.
- **Used for**: Logs, temp files, and any non-persistent data.

---
## ⚡ Ephemeral Storage (Temporary)

- **Exists only during container lifetime**
- Data is **lost** when the container stops or is removed
- Stored in the container's writable layer (Copy-on-Write)

### 🔸 Characteristics:
- Image layers = **Read-only**
- Container layer = **Writable**
- Best for **short-term tasks** or **stateless apps**

---

## 💾 Persistent Storage

- Survives container stop/restart/removal
- Used to **retain data** beyond container lifecycle
- Critical for **databases, user uploads, logs**, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Docker Storage Types

### 1. **Volumes** (Preferred)

- Managed by Docker
- Stored in: `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
- Portable, safe, and works well with Docker Swarm

#### 🔹 Create a volume:
```bash
docker volume create my-volume
```

#### 🔹 Use volume in a container:
```bash
docker run -d -v my-volume:/data nginx
```

---

### 2. **Bind Mounts**

- Mounts a **specific path** from host into container
- Direct access to host files

#### 🔹 Example:
```bash
docker run -d -v /host/data:/container/data my_image
```

#### ⚠️ Less Portable:
- Tightly coupled with host file system
- Not ideal for sharing across environments

---

### 3. **tmpfs Mounts** (In-Memory)

- Temporary storage in **RAM**
- Super fast, no disk I/O
- **Data lost on restart** or shutdown

#### 🔹 Example:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --tmpfs /app/cache:size=64m ubuntu bash
```

# **Storage Drivers**

Docker uses **Storage Drivers** to manage how data is **stored and accessed** in the container’s filesystem.

---

### **Types of Storage Drivers**

1. **Overlay2 (Default Driver)**  
   - Uses **Copy-on-Write** mechanism.  
   - A **base image** is shared across multiple containers, with each container having its own **read-write layer**.

   **Example:**  
   - Containers **C1**, **C2**, and **C3** use the same base image layer, but each has a unique **read-write layer** for modifications.

---

2. **AUFS (Advanced Multilayer Universal File System)**  
   - Supports **Copy-on-Write**.  
   - Combines multiple layers of files into a **unified view**.

---

3. **Device Mapper**  
   - Uses **block-level operations** to allocate storage.  
   - Ideal for systems that need **block-level management** and **high performance**.

---

### **Important Command: Cleaning Unused Volumes**  
```bash
docker volume prune
```
- Deletes **unused volumes** to free up space.

---

# **NFS (Network File System)**

### **What is NFS?**  
NFS is a **shared storage solution** that allows multiple machines to **access the same storage** over a network.

---

### **When to Use NFS?**  
- When you have **multiple machines** and want them to use **shared storage**.  
- **Example:**  
  - You have **3 servers** that need to access the **same database files**.

---

### **Setup Steps for NFS**  
1. **Install NFS Kernel on the Server**  
   ```bash
   apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
   ```
2. **Install NFS on Client Machines**  
   ```bash
   apt-get install nfs-common
   ```

---

# **Docker Networking**

Docker Networking allows **containers** to communicate with:  
- Each other.  
- The **host machine**.  
- **External networks**.

---

### **Why is Docker Networking Important?**  
- Docker containers are **isolated** by default.  
- Networking provides a **logical layer** for containers to **interact** securely.

---

### **Types of Docker Networks**

1. **Bridge Network**  
   - The **default network** for Docker containers.  
   - Containers can communicate **within the same host**.  
   - Ideal for **local development**.

2. **Host Network**  
   - Removes the **network isolation** between the container and the host.  
   - The container shares the **host’s network stack**.

3. **None Network**  
   - Completely disables networking for the container.  
   - Ideal for **security-focused** applications.

4. **Overlay Network**  
   - Used in **Docker Swarm** to enable communication between containers across **multiple hosts**.

5. **Macvlan Network**  
   - Assigns a **unique MAC address** to each container.  
   - Containers appear as **separate devices** on the network.
