## Prometheus Storage

### Types of Storage

- **Local Storage (TSDB)**

---

## 📊 1. **Prometheus Metric Sample**
```text
http_requests_total{method="GET", status="200"} => 250 at 2025-04-17T12:00:00Z
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- **`http_requests_total`**: A **counter** metric that increases over time, tracking total HTTP requests.
- **Labels**: Key-value pairs used to differentiate this metric:
  - `method="GET"` → the HTTP method.
  - `status="200"` → the HTTP response status code.
- **Value**: `250` means Prometheus has recorded 250 successful GET requests so far.
- **Timestamp**: When this value was recorded → `2025-04-17T12:00:00Z`.

This is a basic but powerful concept: **metrics + labels** let you filter and aggregate data for dashboards, alerts, and capacity planning.

---

## 🏗️ 2. **Prometheus Storage System**

Prometheus stores time series data locally using a custom **TSDB (Time Series Database)**.

### 🗂️ Directory Structure Breakdown:

```
/prometheus
├── WAL/                   # Write-Ahead Log
├── chunks_head/           # Head Block (in-memory data not compacted yet)
├── 01FJ.../               # Compacted block (2-hour segments)
│   ├── chunks/            # Compressed chunks of data
│   ├── index              # Label index for querying
│   └── meta.json          # Metadata (block start/end time)
└── lock                   # Ensures only one Prometheus process accesses the data
```

### 🧠 Components Explained:

#### ✅ WAL/ (Write-Ahead Log)
- Temporary storage for new data **before** it’s saved into blocks.
- Ensures **data recovery** in case of crashes.
- Rolled into the head block periodically.

#### ✅ chunks_head/
- **Recent in-memory data**.
- Represents **active time series**.
- It’s not yet compacted; compacted blocks only happen every **2 hours**.
- **If Prometheus is restarted, WAL + this gets replayed to restore state**.

#### ✅ Compacted Block Directory (e.g., `01FJ...`)
- Created after **compaction** (typically 2 hours of data).
- Each contains:
  - `chunks/` → actual compressed samples
  - `index` → fast lookup for labels & series
  - `meta.json` → start and end timestamp of this block, and metadata

---

## ⏱️ 3. **Retention Settings**

Set using Prometheus **startup flags** (not in `prometheus.yml`):

```yaml
command:
  - "--storage.tsdb.retention.time=45d"
  - "--storage.tsdb.retention.size=30GB"
```

### 💡 Details:

#### `--storage.tsdb.retention.time=45d`
- Keep time series data for the **last 45 days**.
- Older data is **deleted automatically** to save space.

#### `--storage.tsdb.retention.size=30GB`
- Prometheus deletes **oldest blocks** if disk usage exceeds 30GB.
- Useful to prevent disk full issues.

You can set **both together**: Prometheus deletes data **when either** limit is reached.

---

## 🐳 4. **Docker Compose Setup**

```yaml
prometheus:
  image: prom/prometheus:latest
  container_name: prometheus
  volumes:
    - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
    - prometheus_data:/prometheus
  ports:
    - "9090:9090"
  networks:
    - monitoring
  command:
    - "--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
    - "--storage.tsdb.retention.time=45d"
    - "--storage.tsdb.retention.size=30GB"
```

### 🧾 Details:

- **Volumes**:
  - `./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`: Custom scrape config.
  - `prometheus_data:/prometheus`: Persist metrics between container restarts.

- **Ports**: 9090 is the Prometheus web UI.

- **Networks**: Use `monitoring` network for integration with Grafana, exporters, etc.

- **Command**: Overrides default settings to include:
  - Config file
  - Retention time (45 days)
  - Retention size (30GB)

---

## 🧠 5. **What prometheus.yml Is For**

The `prometheus.yml` config file is used **only for scrape-related settings**:

### 🎯 Responsibilities:

- Scrape targets (e.g., Node Exporter, cAdvisor)
- Scrape interval (default: 15s)
- Job labels
- Relabeling rules
- External service discovery (Kubernetes, Consul, etc.)
- Recording & alerting rules
- Remote write / read

### ❌ What it does *not* include:
- **Storage configuration**
- **Retention settings**
- **Disk usage limits**

Those are **command-line flags** or Docker args, not YAML configs.

# 🧠 Prometheus Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) and Chunks Head: In-Depth

---

## 🟡 1. What is a Write-Ahead Log (WAL)?

A **Write-Ahead Log** is a file where changes are **written first** before they are applied to the actual database.
1. **Buffer incoming data** in memory.
2. **Persist data on disk quickly**, before it’s compacted and stored in long-term blocks.
3. **Recover data** in case Prometheus crashes or is shut down ungracefully
   
- **Purpose:** Ensures **durability** and **recovery** in case Prometheus crashes or restarts.
- **What it stores:** Every time a new sample is ingested, Prometheus **immediately writes it to the WAL** before doing
anything else.
- **Stored files:** Named sequentially (e.g. `00000014`, `00000015`, etc.), plus optional checkpoints

### 🔍 Key Points:

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Definition** | A file that stores incoming metric data **before** it is processed and saved permanently. |
| **Location** | `/prometheus/wal/` |
| **File Names** | Sequential: `00000001`, `00000002`, ..., plus optional `checkpoint.XXXX` folders |
| **Purpose** | Acts as a **buffered write log** for reliability and recovery |

---

## 🔁 2. Why WAL is Important

| Goal | How WAL Helps |
|------|---------------|
| **Data durability** | Prevents data loss during unexpected crashes |
| **Crash recovery** | Replays logs on restart to rebuild in-memory chunks |
| **High performance** | Buffers writes efficiently before compaction |

---

## 🧭 3. WAL Workflow – Step-by-Step

### 🔂 Data Flow:
1. 🟢 Scrape: Prometheus scrapes metrics from targets.
2. 📝 **Write to WAL**: The sample is immediately written to a WAL segment.
3. 🧠 **Store in memory (Chunks Head)** for fast querying.
4. 📦 Every 2 hours, data is **compacted into TSDB blocks**.
5. 🧹 Old WAL segments are deleted after checkpointing.

---

## 📄 4. WAL File Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `00000001`, `00000002`, etc. | Actual WAL segment files with ingested samples |
| `checkpoint.XXXX` folders | Snapshots used to **speed up recovery** |
| Metadata files | Track segment start/end positions, transaction markers |

---

## 🧠 5. Chunks Head — Active In-Memory Buffer

**Chunks Head** is where Prometheus stores **active time series data** before it's flushed into a permanent block.

- **Purpose:** This holds the actual **in-memory time series chunks** before they are flushed into persistent block
storage (~2-hour blocks).
- **What it stores:** Time series data points that are **actively being collected and not yet compacted**.
- **When it’s used:** These chunks are **not flushed to disk** until a block is created. Until then, they live in memory and
are backed by WAL.

### 🧾 Details:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Path** | `/prometheus/chunks_head/` |
| **Purpose** | Holds in-memory chunks for fast updates & reads |
| **Backed by** | WAL (for durability) |
| **Compacted every** | ~2 hours (default) |
| **Stored data** | Raw time series samples (`timestamp`, `value`, `labels`) |

---

## 🔁 6. Relationship Between WAL & Chunks Head

| Step | WAL | Chunks Head |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Initial write | ✅ (on disk) | ✅ (in memory) |
| During active collection | Used for recovery | Used for fast querying |
| After compaction | May be checkpointed & deleted | Flushed into block |
| On restart | WAL is replayed | Chunks Head is reconstructed |

---

## 🧱 7. TSDB Block Structure (Created from Chunks Head)

Every 2 hours, data in Chunks Head is compacted into a block directory:

```
/prometheus/01FJXXXX/
├── chunks/      # Compressed time series data
├── index        # Label/series index
└── meta.json    # Metadata (timestamps, source info)
```

---

## 🗃️ 8. WAL Lifecycle in Summary

```plaintext
Scrape → WAL (disk) → Chunks Head (memory) → TSDB Block (permanent)
```

1. **Scraped** sample is written to WAL and memory.
2. WAL persists data even if Prometheus crashes.
3. Chunks Head builds compressed chunks.
4. Compactor creates a TSDB block every 2h.
5. WAL segments are **checkpointed and deleted** post-block creation.

---

## 🔧 9. How to Configure Retention (Optional but Important)

These are not in `prometheus.yml`, but passed as flags in Docker or systemd:

```yaml
command:
  - "--storage.tsdb.retention.time=45d"
  - "--storage.tsdb.retention.size=30GB"
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` | Retain time series for 45 days |
| `--storage.tsdb.retention.size` | Cap storage usage at 30GB |

---

## 📌 10. Key Facts Summary Table

| Concept          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| WAL              | Fast disk write log for durability |
| Chunks Head      | In-memory buffer of recent time series |
| Checkpoint       | Optimized snapshot of WAL |
| Compaction       | Happens ~every 2h, flushes memory to disk |
| Block Directory  | Contains `chunks`, `index`, and `meta.json` |
| WAL Files        | Sequentially numbered, deleted post-compaction |
| Recovery         | WAL replayed to rebuild memory after crash |

### Remote Storage
---

# 📦 Prometheus Remote Storage and Best Practices

## Remote Storage Integration
For **long-term durability** and **centralized querying**, Prometheus can **integrate with remote storage systems**.

Prometheus supports two types of remote integrations:

- **Remote Write**: Push data to external systems  
  (e.g., **Thanos**, **Cortex**, **VictoriaMetrics**, **InfluxDB**)

- **Remote Read**: Query remote data back into Prometheus UI / via PromQL.

### Example Configuration:
```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://thanos-receive:10902/api/v1/receive"

remote_read:
  - url: "http://thanos-query:9090"
```

---

# ⚙️ Thanos Integration (for Centralized, Scalable Storage)
- **Thanos Receive** will accept remote writes.
- **Thanos Query** will serve remote reads, allowing you to query long-term and short-term data seamlessly.

---

# 🖥️ Node Exporter Metrics
- **Exporter Port**: `9100`
- Used to collect **node (server) metrics** like CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.

---

# 🛡️ Best Practices for Prometheus Storage

1. **Monitor Disk Space**  
   - Always monitor your Prometheus server's storage.
   - Alert if usage crosses critical thresholds.

2. **Optimize Retention Periods**  
   - Set Prometheus' `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` wisely based on your needs (e.g., 15 days, 30 days).
   
3. **Use External Storage**  
   - For long-term retention and scalability, integrate external systems like **Thanos**, **Cortex**, etc.

4. **Implement Sharding**  
   - In large-scale environments, deploy **multiple Prometheus instances**.
   - Use a load balancer or scrape sharding to distribute the ingestion load.

5. **Regular Cleanup**  
   - Configure automatic cleanup of old data.
   - Ensure blocks or WAL files older than the retention period are deleted automatically.

## Alertmanager

### Why Alerts Are Needed

- Proactive Monitoring
- Prevent Downtime
- SLA Compliance
- Automation
- Faster Response
- Reduce Alert Fatigue
- Better Decision-Making

### Alert Types

- Threshold Alerts
- State Change Alerts
- Anomaly Alerts
- Business Metrics

### Features

- Ingestion, Deduplication, Grouping
- Inhibition, Silencing, Routing

### Workflow

1. Prometheus triggers alert
2. Alertmanager applies rules
3. Alertmanager sends notification

### Alert Rule Example (`alerts.yml`)

```yaml
groups:
  - name: node_exporter_alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="user"}[1m]) > 0.5
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU usage detected"
          description: "CPU usage on {{ $labels.instance }} is above the threshold."
```

### Configure Prometheus to Use Alert Rules

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
rule_files:
  - alerts.yml
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9093']
```

### Alertmanager Email Example

```yaml
route:
  receiver: 'email-team'
receivers:
  - name: 'email-team'
    email_configs:
      - to: 'devops-team@example.com'
        from: 'alertmanager@example.com'
        smarthost: 'smtp.example.com:587'
        auth_username: 'alertmanager@example.com'
        auth_password: 'your_smtp_password'
```

---

## Configuring Alerts Using Slack

### Steps

1. Create Slack channel
2. Create Incoming Webhook from Slack API
3. Configure `alertmanager.yml` with webhook

```yaml
route:
  receiver: slack
receivers:
  - name: slack
    slack_configs:
      - channel: "#temp-devops-assignment-1"
        api_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
        send_resolved: true
        text: |
          *Alert:* {{ .CommonAnnotations.summary }}
          {{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}
```

---

## Push Gateway

### Purpose

- For ephemeral jobs or short-lived batch processes

### How It Works

1. Metrics pushed via HTTP to Pushgateway
2. Stored temporarily
3. Scraped by Prometheus

### `docker-compose.yml` Example

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  pushgateway:
    image: prom/pushgateway:latest
    ports:
      - "9091:9091"
    volumes:
      - ./pushgateway-data:/data
    command:
      - "--persistence.file=/data/pushgateway.db"
```

### Example Metrics Push

```bash
echo "db_backup_duration_seconds 12.4" | \
  curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/db-backup
```
