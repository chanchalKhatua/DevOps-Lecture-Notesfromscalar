Hereâ€™s a properly structured **Markdown (.md)** file based on **ALL** the information from your PDF without missing anything.

# Getting Started with Grafana

## Agenda
- Docker Compose
- KutumetI Outmanager
- Deployments

## 1. Introduction to Grafana

Grafana is a **universal dashboard tool** that connects to various data sources (like Prometheus, MySQL, or cloud services) and transforms raw numbers into intuitive graphs and alerts.  
It is primarily used for:
- **Monitoring**
- **Visualization**
- **Analysis of metrics and logs**

---

### 1.1 What Kind of Data Does Grafana Support?
---
### Grafana primarily supports **two types** of data:

### 1. **Time Series Data** (Main focus)
- **Definition**: Data points collected or generated **over time**, with a timestamp attached to each value.
- **Examples**:
  - âœ… CPU usage over time (e.g., CPU at 30% at 12:00, 45% at 12:01)
  - âœ… Memory usage every 10 seconds
  - âœ… HTTP request count per minute
  - âœ… Revenue tracked hourly/daily/weekly
- **Purpose**: Great for monitoring system metrics, application performance, website traffic, financial data over time, etc.

Grafana **excels** at visualizing time series â€” line graphs, bar graphs, heatmaps, etc.

---

### 2. **Non-Time Series Data (Tabular, Logs, Annotations)** (Secondary)

- Grafana can also handle:
  - **Tabular data**: (like tables, lists) â€” e.g., inventory counts, order fulfillment status.
  - **Logs**: streaming logs from sources like Loki, Elasticsearch, etc.
  - **Annotations**: manual or automatic notes on graphs.
- Examples:
  - âœ… Inventory counts (current stock status â€” typically **tabular** or **snapshot** data)
  - âœ… Order fulfillment stats (can be event-driven or table format)
---

### In Your Examples:

| Example                      | Type           | Notes |
|-------------------------------|----------------|-------|
| CPU usage over time           | Time Series    | Very common in Grafana |
| Memory usage every 10 seconds | Time Series    | Classic example |
| HTTP request count per minute | Time Series    | Web server monitoring |
| Revenue per region            | **Time Series** if tracked over time, otherwise Tabular |
| Order fulfillment stats       | Tabular or Time Series (depends on how it's collected) |
| Inventory counts              | Mostly Tabular (snapshot at a time), or Time Series if changes are tracked |

---

### ðŸ”¥ Quick Summary:

| Data Type       | Grafana Support | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Time Series     | âœ… Best suited   | Most Grafana panels are built for this |
| Tabular         | âœ… Supported     | Shown via Table panels |
| Logs            | âœ… Supported     | If Grafana is connected to Loki, Elasticsearch, etc. |
| Annotations     | âœ… Supported     | Mark important events on graphs |

### 1.2 Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Rich panel types and custom dashboards.
- **Data Source Integration**:
  - Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite (Time series)
  - Loki (Logs)
  - Tempo (Traces)
      - A trace shows the journey of a single request as it travels through various parts (services, APIs, databases) of a distributed system.
      - Each span inside a trace represents one step (like an API call, a database query, etc.).
  - Elasticsearch, OpenSearch
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL (SQL)
  - Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring, AWS CloudWatch
- **Templating**: Dynamic dashboards with variables.
- **Alerting and Notifications**: Set thresholds and send alerts through various channels.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Native plugins
  - Custom plugins
- **Dashboard Provisioning**: Automate dashboard creation.
- **Folder and Team Organization**: Group dashboards into folders and manage access.
- **Logs and Traces Integration**:
  - Investigate incidents or performance issues
  - Drill into logs, metrics, or traces without modifying dashboards
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Time range comparisons (e.g., today vs. yesterday)
  - Transformations (joins, calculations, renaming directly in the UI)
  - Statistical summaries (mean, sum, count, percentiles, etc.)
  - Real-time data exploration
  - Ad-hoc querying and troubleshooting through the Explore section

---

## 2. Installation

After installing Grafana (via Docker Compose, direct binary, or cloud setup), you can begin exploring the UI.

### 2.1 Explore Section

 - ad hoc querying
 - troubleshooting
 - real time data exploration
 - Investigate incidents or performance issues.
 - Run custom queries on your data sources.
 - Drill into logs, metrics, or traces without modifying dashboards.
 - Compare different time ranges or variables on the fly

#### **Panels** 
 - are the **core building blocks** of a Grafana dashboard â€” each panel **visualizes specific data** from your
   data sources.

---

## 3. Building a Simple Dashboard

### 3.1 Different Types of Visualizations
- **Time Series**
- **Bar Chart**
- **Stat**
- **Gauge**
- **Bar Gauge**
- **Table**
- **Pie Chart**

> Panels are the visual representation of your data, and you can customize them extensively.

---

### 3.2 Organizing Dashboards and Grouping Panels
- Group multiple dashboards into **folders**.
- Use **teams** and **roles** for access management.

---

### 3.3 Time Range and Auto Refresh
- Set **global time ranges** (like last 5 minutes, last 24 hours).
- Enable **auto-refresh** for live monitoring.
- Use **time range comparisons** to analyze trends over different periods.

---

## 4. Connecting Prometheus with Grafana

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Deploy Node Exporter** on the server to expose system metrics.
2. **Prometheus** pulls data from Node Exporter.
3. **Grafana** connects to **Prometheus** as a **data source**.
4. Create dashboards based on real-time Prometheus metrics.

Example Query:
```promql
rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])
```
This query shows the idle CPU rate over the past 5 minutes.

---

# Summary
Grafana provides a flexible, powerful way to monitor, visualize, and analyze your infrastructure and application metrics in real time.  
By integrating it with Prometheus and other data sources, you can build dynamic dashboards, set up real-time alerting, and explore metrics efficiently.

Would you also like me to generate a ready-to-download `.md` file? ðŸ“„  
If yes, I can provide it immediately! ðŸš€  
Also, do you want a *basic diagram* of how Prometheus + Grafana connect? (it'll be easy to understand visually!) ðŸŽ¯
