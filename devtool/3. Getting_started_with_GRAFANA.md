Hereâ€™s a properly structured **Markdown (.md)** file based on **ALL** the information from your PDF without missing anything.

# Getting Started with Grafana

## Agenda
- Docker Compose
- KutumetI Outmanager
- Deployments

## 1. Introduction to Grafana

Grafana is a **universal dashboard tool** that connects to various data sources (like Prometheus, MySQL, or cloud services) and transforms raw numbers into intuitive graphs and alerts.  
It is primarily used for:
- **Monitoring**
- **Visualization**
- **Analysis of metrics and logs**

---

### 1.1 What Kind of Data Does Grafana Support?

#### Timeseries Data:
- CPU usage over time
- Memory usage every 10 seconds
- HTTP request count per minute
- Revenue per region
- Order fulfillment statistics
- Inventory counts

#### Tabular Data:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL

#### Logs:
- Loki

#### Traces:
- Tempo

#### Static Business Data:
- Business analytics, finance reports, etc.

---

### 1.2 Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Rich panel types and custom dashboards.
- **Data Source Integration**:
  - Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite (Time series)
  - Loki (Logs)
  - Tempo (Traces)
  - Elasticsearch, OpenSearch
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL (SQL)
  - Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring, AWS CloudWatch
- **Templating**: Dynamic dashboards with variables.
- **Alerting and Notifications**: Set thresholds and send alerts through various channels.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Native plugins
  - Custom plugins
- **Dashboard Provisioning**: Automate dashboard creation.
- **Folder and Team Organization**: Group dashboards into folders and manage access.
- **Logs and Traces Integration**:
  - Investigate incidents or performance issues
  - Drill into logs, metrics, or traces without modifying dashboards
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Time range comparisons (e.g., today vs. yesterday)
  - Transformations (joins, calculations, renaming directly in the UI)
  - Statistical summaries (mean, sum, count, percentiles, etc.)
  - Real-time data exploration
  - Ad-hoc querying and troubleshooting through the Explore section

---

## 2. Installation

After installing Grafana (via Docker Compose, direct binary, or cloud setup), you can begin exploring the UI.

### 2.1 Exploring the UI
- **Dashboard**: Collection of Panels.
- **Panels**: Core building blocks of a Grafana dashboard. Each panel visualizes specific data.
- **Explore Section**: For real-time data exploration and ad-hoc querying.

---

## 3. Building a Simple Dashboard

### 3.1 Different Types of Visualizations
- **Time Series**
- **Bar Chart**
- **Stat**
- **Gauge**
- **Bar Gauge**
- **Table**
- **Pie Chart**

> Panels are the visual representation of your data, and you can customize them extensively.

---

### 3.2 Organizing Dashboards and Grouping Panels
- Group multiple dashboards into **folders**.
- Use **teams** and **roles** for access management.

---

### 3.3 Time Range and Auto Refresh
- Set **global time ranges** (like last 5 minutes, last 24 hours).
- Enable **auto-refresh** for live monitoring.
- Use **time range comparisons** to analyze trends over different periods.

## 4. Connecting Prometheus with Grafana

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Deploy Node Exporter** on the server to expose system metrics.
2. **Prometheus** pulls data from Node Exporter.
3. **Grafana** connects to **Prometheus** as a **data source**.
4. Create dashboards based on real-time Prometheus metrics.

Example Query:
```promql
rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])
```
This query shows the idle CPU rate over the past 5 minutes.

# Summary
Grafana provides a flexible, powerful way to monitor, visualize, and analyze your infrastructure and application metrics in real time.  
By integrating it with Prometheus and other data sources, you can build dynamic dashboards, set up real-time alerting, and explore metrics efficiently.

Would you also like me to generate a ready-to-download `.md` file? ðŸ“„  
If yes, I can provide it immediately! ðŸš€  
Also, do you want a *basic diagram* of how Prometheus + Grafana connect? (it'll be easy to understand visually!) ðŸŽ¯
